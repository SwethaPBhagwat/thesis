\section{Motivation}

Angular control in LIGO is an important contribution to the noise budget at the frequencies of highest sensitivity \cite{T0900511}. 

There are four different angular modes for the two Fabry-Perot arms in the LIGO interferometer, shown in figure \ref{fig:sidlessiggmodes}. 
The two hard modes are stable as the power increases, which means that the radiation pressure will push the mirrors back to an equilibrium position.
The two soft modes are unstable as the power increases, pushing the mirrors away from equilibrium. 
Despite being stable, the hard modes still exhibit a resonant behavior that will need to be damped.

\label{fig:sidlessiggmodes}%
\end{figure}

Angular noise can couple in to differential arm length (DARM) though the interaction between beam spot motion (BSM) and angular motion ($\theta$) on mirrors. This happens in two ways: both a static offset in the BSM with mirror angular noise and a static angular offset with BSM noise can create DARM noise. 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\Delta L}(f) = \hat{d}_{spot}(f)*\hat{\theta}_{Mirror}(f) \approx \hat{d}_{spot}(f)*\theta_{Mirror}^{RMS}(f) + d_{spot}^{RMS}(f)*\hat{\theta}_{Mirror}(f)
\label{eq:darmcouple}
\end{equation}

Barsotti and Evans showed that in Science Mode, angular noise from Common Soft and Differential Soft (the two modes of the arms that are unstable at high power) contribute the most to DARM noise. They also showed that in the final design of aLIGO, the soft mode is unstable with frequencies of -.17 and -.21 Hz for pitch and yaw, respectively. The control systems currently used for angular control must be used to damp the unstable modes and the resonances of the stable modes, which leads to injected sensing noise. For an optical angular control system to be useful, it must provide damping in that frequency range to stabilize the modes.

Using angular trapping methods, we can reduce the sensing noise injection by damping the angular motion $\hat{\theta}_{Mirror}(f)$.

\section{Applying angular control}

For our discussion, we will disregard the distinction between common and differential modes of the interferometer.

%In this design, we use radiation pressure to couple e.g. the ETM (about 40 kg) to two much larger masses (about 400 kg each) made out of stainless steel. In this fashion, we can damp the angular motion of the test mass relative to the hopefully much more stable masses on the side.

\subsection{Single spring 4km damping}

If we assume that the length will be stabilized with the main beam of the interferometer, we only really need to control the angular motion. We will consider only the yaw of the mirrors for this exploration, but there should not be any obstacles to applying the method to both pitch and yaw. 

It seems like we could do this with a single folded cavity (see fig \ref{fig:longtrapfoldeddiagram}). In this configuration, ETMs and ITMs would have `Buddy' mirrors attached to the sides to create an angular optical spring cavity.

This has several benefits that look quite appealing. The yaw of the ETM is damped relative to the ITM. If implemented ideally, the radiation pressure will be independent of small angular motions of the ETM. This particular configuration (see table \ref{tab:foldedos} has a UGF of about 8 Hz, so it should also damp the hard mode (Barsotti and Evans give a hard mode frequency of 3.05 Hz). This would also, as a byproduct, give a very sensitive readout of the yaw of the ETM via the PDH error signal.

There are several concerns that would need to be addressed. This configuration could actively couple angular noise in the ITM into length noise at the ETM. It would also require massive engineering changes to manufacture and align a monolithic test mass with Buddy mirrors bonded onto the sides. These mirrors would also need to be very carefully manufactured and attached, because the cavity could not be realigned once assembled.  

The design has to be careful of losses due to long-storage-time optical cavities\cite{Isogai13}, but the finesse is low enough in this configuration ($F=7850$) to avoid a significant impact from the effects. The design also has the potential to introduce increased thermal noise to the length degree of freedom, due to the added buddy mirrors. We have neglected the thermal noise effects in this analysis, but it should be addressed.

Table \ref{tab:foldedos} lists the parameters for a possible optical spring design. If we lock the laser to the frequency of the main cavity laser, we can take advantage of the fantastic frequency stabilization of a 4 km cavity, and also remove the common mode length noise of associated with relative frequency fluctuations. The very small frequency detunings would still present a significant challenge to implement and maintain.
