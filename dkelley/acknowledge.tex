I would like to thank a number of people for helping me during the course of my studies. Without any one of these people, this would have been
a far less productive experience.

My adviser, Stefan Ballmer, provided a vast trove of knowledge and many helpful insights in lab.

Antonio Perreca, as a postdoc and my friend, gave me invaluable lessons in optics, organization, and life in general.  

James Lough, Fabian Manga\~na-Sandoval, and Thomas Vo, as my cohort in lab, have kept me going in the right direction and shared in many victories, both small and large. 

Peter Saulson has provided much appreciated guidance and insights about everything from dielectric mirrors to regional variations in breakfast preferences.

Lou Buda, Charlie Brown, Phil Arnold, and Lester Schmutzler have provided me with countless hours of help, advice, and conversation.

Joan Kelley made a custom dust cover for the vacuum chamber that proved very useful and durable.  

Emma Tolley has graciously listened to my rambling about optics in the wee hours of the morning, and has remained supportive despite it.

%As a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, I have been fortunate to
%have benefited through advice from and discussions with many people. It would
%not be possible to thank everyone who I have worked with over the past five
%years without making these acknowledgments the longest chapter in this
%dissertation, so I shall only attempt to thank those who I have interacted
%with the most and hope that the others forgive me.
%
%First and foremost, I would like to thank Patrick Brady for his constant
%guidance and patience over the past five years as my advisor and my friend. I
%have been fortunate to work with someone with the ability and integrity of
%Patrick.  I hope that our collaboration can continue for many years.
%
%I would also like to thank Jolien Creighton for his help and enthusiasm over
%the past five years. It has been fun working with Jolien and I have learnt a
%great deal from him.
%
%I am grateful to Bruce Allen for suggesting the search for binary inspiral as
%a research topic and his assistance with the scientific and computational
%obstacles along the way. Thanks also to Gabriela Gonz\'{a}lez for patiently
%answering my many stupid questions about the LIGO interferometers helping me
%understand the data that I have been analyzing, and to Scott Koranda for
%helping me get the data analyzed.
%
%I would like to thank the members of my committee: Daniel Agterberg, John
%Friedman and Leonard Parker for their careful reading of this dissertation and
%helpful suggestions for its improvement.
%
%I also would like to thank Warren Anderson, Teviet Creighton, Stephen
%Fairhurst, Eirini Messaritaki, Ben Owen, Xavier Siemens and Alan Wiseman for
%help, advice and pints of beer. I am also indebted to Axel's for stimulating
%many useful discussions.
%
%Thanks to Steve Nelson, Wyatt Osato and Quiana Robinson for their help in the
%preparation of this dissertation and, of course, to Sue Arthur for making
%everything run smoothly.
%
%I could not have come this far without the constant love and support of my
%parents, to whom this thesis is dedicated. Finally, I would like to thank
%Emily Dobbins for all her love and understanding over the past two years.
