%As a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, I have been fortunate to
%have benefited through advice from and discussions with many people. It would
%not be possible to thank everyone who I have worked with over the past five
%years without making these acknowledgments the longest chapter in this
%dissertation, so I shall only attempt to thank those who I have interacted
%with the most and hope that the others forgive me.
%
%First and foremost, I would like to thank Patrick Brady for his constant
%guidance and patience over the past five years as my advisor and my friend. I
%have been fortunate to work with someone with the ability and integrity of
%Patrick.  I hope that our collaboration can continue for many years.
%
%I would also like to thank Jolien Creighton for his help and enthusiasm over
%the past five years. It has been fun working with Jolien and I have learnt a
%great deal from him.
%
%I am grateful to Bruce Allen for suggesting the search for binary inspiral as
%a research topic and his assistance with the scientific and computational
%obstacles along the way. Thanks also to Gabriela Gonz\'{a}lez for patiently
%answering my many stupid questions about the LIGO interferometers helping me
%understand the data that I have been analyzing, and to Scott Koranda for
%helping me get the data analyzed.
%
%I would like to thank the members of my committee: Daniel Agterberg, John
%Friedman and Leonard Parker for their careful reading of this dissertation and
%helpful suggestions for its improvement.
%
%I also would like to thank Warren Anderson, Teviet Creighton, Stephen
%Fairhurst, Eirini Messaritaki, Ben Owen, Xavier Siemens and Alan Wiseman for
%help, advice and pints of beer. I am also indebted to Axel's for stimulating
%many useful discussions.
%
%Thanks to Steve Nelson, Wyatt Osato and Quiana Robinson for their help in the
%preparation of this dissertation and, of course, to Sue Arthur for making
%everything run smoothly.
%
%I could not have come this far without the constant love and support of my
%parents, to whom this thesis is dedicated. Finally, I would like to thank
%Emily Dobbins for all her love and understanding over the past two years.
