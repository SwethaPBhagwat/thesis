\section{Subcarrier Servo}
the subcarrier servo is designed to lock a VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) a set frequency away from a crystal oscillator. The is accomplished through two mixers and some feedback.

We typically monitor two spots in this system: The output of the fast mixer (ZMY-3) and the drive signal from the variable oscillator (200 KHz on the diagram). When locked, the two should have the same frequency and be phase locked.

%\section{Introduction}
%
%We're going to take a single oscillator, and beat it against a time delayed version of itself to figure out the phase noise.  This method should work for any oscillator, though there are `dead spots' in the spectrum due to resonance that we have to be careful about.
%
%Let's cover some variables...
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Oscillator Frequency $f_{osc} = 80 \mbox{MHz}$
%\item Speed of light in BNC cables $s = 0.66 c$
%\item Volt of mixer DC offset per radian of phase: $g_{rad}=0.34 \mbox{V/rad}$
%\item Delay Cycles $n=3$ 
%\item Time delay $T=\frac{n}{f_{osc}}$
%\item Phase noise measurement frequency $f_{meas}=1 \mbox{KHz}$  
%\end{itemize}
%
%$$A e^{i(\omega t+\phi(t))}   \otimes B e^{i(\omega (t-T)+\phi(t-T))} = A(\omega) e^{i(\omega T+\phi(t)-\phi(t-T))} $$
%
%Our friendly spectrum analyzer does an FFT on it...
%
%$$\phi(\omega) (1-e^{i\omega T}) \approx \phi(\omega) i \omega T$$
%
%then we can ask ourselves, ``how accurately can I measure this noise?''  Assuming a spectrum analyzer noise floor of $1 \mbox{nV}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$
%
%$$\phi_{min}=\frac{1 \mbox{nV}}{\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}} \frac{1}{g_{rad}}\frac{1}{2\pi f_{meas}T}$$
%$$=\frac{1 \mbox{nRad}}{0.34\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}}\frac{f_{osc}}{2\pi (1\mbox{KHz})(n)}$$
%$$=\frac{1 \mbox{nRad}}{0.34\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}}\frac{f_{osc}}{2\pi (1\mbox{KHz})(n)}$$
%$$=\frac{37}{n} \frac{\mu Rad}{\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}}$$
%
%This is the smallest phase noise that we could measure for a given $n$.  Note that, with a wavelength of about 2.5 m, it is feasable to consider an $n$ up to perhaps 20.
%
%Next question is: how does phase noise affect our noise in the cavity (in $m/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$)?
%
%$$ f_n(\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d}{dt}\phi_n(\omega) = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \phi_n$$
%
%$$FSR+f_n=c/(2L+x_n)\approx\frac{c}{2L}\left(1-\frac{x_n}{2L}\right)$$
%
%current nosie estimate is $10^{-17}m/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$
%
%$$f_n = \frac{c}{2L}\left(1-\frac{x_n}{2L}\right)-FSR = 1.3\times 10^{-7}$$
%
%$$\Delta x \approx \frac{\lambda_0^2}{2L}$$ distance between peaks in an FSR
%
%so our lower bound in phase noise measurement should be below
%
%$$\phi_n = f_n \frac{2\pi}{\omega}= 8.4\times10^{-10} rad/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$$

\subsection{Method}

We are going to look at the spectrum of the oscillators near 80 MHz to figure out the amount of frequency noise from these oscillaotrs.  We're mostly concerned with the freqeuncy noise at 1 KHz.

We begin by assuming that all voltage noise is phase noise (no change in the amplitude).  This method gives an upper limit to the noise in the system.

$\omega_m$ is a measurement frequency.  $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency

$$V(t) = V_0 e^{i(\omega_c t + \phi(t))}$$

In the frequency domain,

$$\delta V(\omega_m) = V_0 \delta \phi(\omega_m) = \frac{2\pi V_0}{\omega_m} \delta f(\omega_m)$$

Keep in mind that to do this properly, you need to sum the effects of the noise at the carrier plus 1 KHz and the carrier minus 1 KHz.


$$\delta f(\omega_m)= \frac{\omega_m \delta V(\omega_m)}{2 \pi V_0} $$

We can now calculate the effect of this frequency noisee on our optical trap cavity.  $f_L$ is the laser frequency.

$$\delta x = \frac{L}{f_L} \delta f = 2.66\times10^{-16} \delta f$$

The noise budget gives a noise floor of $10^{-17}$, so to get in under that, we need a $\delta f <<\frac{1}{26.6}$


\subsection{Results}

With the subcarrier servo locked at approximately 200 KHz, the noises we measure are:

80 MHz Oscillator: frequency noise $5.4\times10^{-3} \frac{Hz}{\sqrt{Hz}}$.  Position noise $1.4\time10^{-18} \frac{m}{\sqrt{Hz}}$.

VCO: frequency noise $6.7\times10^{-2} \frac{Hz}{\sqrt{Hz}}$.  Position noise $1.7\time10^{-17} \frac{m}{\sqrt{Hz}}$.

These noise values are OK for the 80 MHz oscillator, but not so much for the VCO.  We suspect that the 200 KHz oscillator may be the culprit.

\section{Loops}

\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:traplock}%
\end{figure}

\caption[Digital loops]{Digital parts of the locking loop.  The yaw and optical lever inputs are not relevant to the longitudinal trap.}%
\label{fig:traplockdig}%
\end{figure}


Here's a picture of the longitudinal trap as it stands.  In general terms, we have a cavity with position and laser feedback, which also has optical spring behavior.  Analog and digital loops are shown in figures \ref{fig:traplock} and \ref{fig:traplockdig}.

You may notice that this layout drawing has an alphabet soup of sections and subsections. I will now describe in excruciating detail what each of these things are and why we care.  I am leaving out the input whitening in analog land and the dewhitening in digital land.  They should cancel out every time, so we just leave them off.  I started drawing in angular control loops, but I won't be addressing them here.

Our goal is to be able to reconstruct the entire optical trap from the control point to the error signal.  In our measurements, we are using the injection input and the two test outputs of the Trap Servo board. Test out A serves as our error signal (OUT) and Test out B serves as our control signal (IN).  The injection happens between the two test outputs. The resulting open loop transfer function is (plotted in figure \ref{fig:OLG})

This is based on Jim's model of the loop, which I have updated and repackaged.

%\begin{equation}
%\frac{F}{1-SO}\left[HLM+\frac{AECP+TCP}{1-PCED}\right]
%\label{eq:loop}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left[FHLM+\frac{FAECP+FTCP}{1+PCED}\right]\frac{1}{1+SO}
\label{eq:loop}
\end{equation}

There are several diffent parts to this equation, so we will take a moment to look each term.  Every term in the numerator includes $F$, the Trap Servo. $FHLM$ is a loop involving the PZT drive of the laser.  $FAECP$ and $FTCP$ both rely on pushing the large mass around using the OSEM drive, but $FAECP$ does the drive through the digital system while $FTCP$ uses an analog connection. $1+PCED$ is the closed loop of the active suspension damping for the large mass; note that this only affects the loops that are driving the large mass. $1+SO$ is the closed loop system of the optical spring, which is dependent on the seperation between the two mirrors, rather than the absolute position of either.



%-360 is a product of two closed loops and one open loop.  The two closed loops are the optical spring, $(1-SO)^{-1}$, and the active seismic damping from the digital system to the OSEMs, $(1-PCED)^{-1}$.  The open loop is the sum of three paths: the feedback of the trap servo through the laser ($FHLM$), the feedback of the trap servo through the digital system to the OSEMs ($FAECP$), and the feedback of the trap servo directly to the OSEM drive ($FTCP$)

%I'm using for reference Jim's code, TrapLoop.m, which is a Matlab class.  The code can be found in /lab/jim/newtrap. There is an example of the code in use, fitplots.m, in /lab/lab2014/TrapServo/20140423/



\subsection{A}

At the moment, this path has been disconnected, because it was not required.  Thus we can set $A=0$.

%The input to this is the signal coming out of the Trap servo. The output is a drive signal which gets added into the OSEM drive of trap 1.  This box has a digital and an analog component.  In the analog section, the signal gets an attenuation $a = 95\Omega/2795\Omega$ via a votage divider.  After that, the signal enters the digital system, where we have the filters in the POS\_PDH\_FEEDBACK filter bank.  At the moment, the only active filter is a lowpass with a single pole at $10 \mbox{Hz}$. The -0.5 is related to the digital system input, the 40/3 is a gain set in the digital system, and the -7 is a fitting parameter.
%
%\begin{equation}
%A = a\frac{-10}{1+\imath f/(10 \mbox{Hz})}\frac{40\cdot (-0.5)\cdot-7}{3\cdot}\left[\frac{\mu\mbox{N}}{\mbox{mV}}\right]\cdot \frac{1000(\mbox{mV/V})}{10^6(\mu\mbox{N}/\mbox{N})}
%\label{eq:A}
%\end{equation}

\subsection{C}

Converts voltage from the DAC into force on the large mirror via the OSEMs.  Factor of 4 because we have 4 OSEMs.  Number comes from logbook 439.

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{4}{4.91793\times 10^{4}\mbox{V/N}}                               
\label{eq:C}
\end{equation}


\subsection{D1 and D2}
The input to each of these blocks the motion of a single optic relative to the OSEMs. The OSEMs put out a current proportional to the position of the mass, which is digitized.  The output is a drive signal which gets added into the OSEM drive of trap 1 and trap 2, respectively.  The position measurements from each optic have filters applied from the TRAP1\_SUSPOS and TRAP2\_SUSPOS filter banks. In D1, we have an AC coupling filter(Z: 0, P: 0.5), a highpass (Z: 1, P: 100), and a fourth order Chebychev lowpass filter at $200\mbox{Hz}$ with $1\mbox{dB}$ of passband ripple (P: $67.3977\pm\imath81.4946$, $27.9074\pm\imath196.677$ G: -0.891251).  There is also a gain of 10, which includes the filter gain, the conversion of position of the optics relative to the OSEMs into voltage, and the conversion from volts to meters in the digital system. See fig. \ref{fig:D}. 

From the Matlab code:

\begin{verbatim}
    tf = (1i*freq - 0) .* (1i*freq - 1)...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / 0.5)...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / 100)...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / (67.3977+1i*81.4946))...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / (67.3977-1i*81.4946))...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / (27.9074+1i*196.677))...
        ./ (1 + 1i*freq / (27.9074-1i*196.677))...
        .* -0.891251...
        .* Dgain;
\end{verbatim}


Why don't we consider the effects of D2?  Because we are not putting any active drive through it. Thus it will not shape the loop as drastically as D1. The coupling between the mirror position and the ring position drop off drastically ($f^{-2}$) above the position resonance of the glass suspension ($\approx 18\mbox{Hz}$). As we improve the lock, we expect that we will be able to reduce or even remove active feedback on the ring.

\caption[D1 transfer function]{D1, the transfer function from the position of optic 1, the input coupler, to a digital drive force. }%
\label{fig:D}%
\end{figure}

\subsection{E}

Converts force output of digital filters into volts so that you can send it out of the digital system. Factor of 4 because we have 4 OSEMs.  Note that $CE = 1$.


\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{4} 4.91793\times 10^{4}\mbox{V/N}
\label{eq:E}
\end{equation}

\subsection{F}

This is the transfer function of the Trap Servo, the RF photodiode, and the mixer.  Input to this is the cavity length, read out through the PDH method. The output is a voltage. The variable `mxrpd,' which is the conversion from cavity length to the voltage output of the mixer, is dependent on power, cavity mode matching, and the PDH readout at the mixer. mxrpd, measured at full power, just below the oscillation point, is about $10^9$ V/m. See fig. \ref{fig:F}.  At the moment, we are only using the 100Hz integrator.  This has been modeled completely with the 'Analog' library in /software/matlab/analog.

\subsection{P}

Pendulum of the large mass. Converts a force to a displacement in the position direction.  Resonant frequency $f_L = 1.4 \mbox{Hz}$.  Large mass $m_L = 300 \mbox{g}$.

\begin{equation}
P = \frac{1}{m_L (2 \pi f_L)^2} \frac{1}{\left(1 - \left[\frac{f}{f_L}\right]^2\right)}
\label{eq:P}

\end{figure}

\subsection{S}

The glass suspension connects the small optic to the ring; it acts as a high-Q spring. An optical lever is used to damp oscillation modes other than the position mode. It converts a force to a displacement in the position direction.  Resonant frequency $f_s = 18 \mbox{Hz}$.  Small mass $m_s = 0.5 \mbox{g}$.

\begin{equation}
S = \frac{1}{m_s (2 \pi f_s)^2}\frac{1}{\left(1 - \left[\frac{f}{f_s}\right]^2\right)}
\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}

\subsection{O}

Optical spring! Depending on detunings and power ratio, we should get stable or unstable behavior. Plotted in figure \ref{fig:O}.  We should note that optical losses before the cavity have to be considered when determining the power in the cavity, as well as the cavity detuning and angular displacements of the mirrors.  At the moment we are calculating this using Finesse.

\label{fig:O}%
\end{figure}

Combining this spring constant with S in a closed loop gives us the behaviour of the optical spring on the small mass, and thus cavity length.  Below, in equation \ref{eq:OS_CL}, is the effect of the optical and mechanical springs on changes in the cavity length.

\frac{1}{1+OS} = \frac{k_m-m\omega^2}{k_m+k_{os}-m\omega^2}
\label{eq:OS_CL}
\end{equation}

\subsection{L}

Laser PZT.  Converts a voltage to a shift in the laser frequency. From product spec sheet.

\begin{equation}
L = -1.7\times 10^6 \mbox{Hz/V}
\label{eq:L}
\end{equation}

\subsection{M}

Cavity.  Small change in laser frequency can be converted into a small change in cavity length.  Cavity length $l = 0.07\mbox{m}$

\begin{equation}
M=\frac{l\lambda_0}{c}
\label{eq:loopM}
\end{equation}


\subsection{H}

HV amplifier (with HV bypass) from measurement. See fig. \ref{fig:H}. The HV bypass is described in ALog 412.  The overall behavior of the amplifier and the bypass is designed to look like this simplified model:
%https://sugwg-alog.phy.syr.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=412 data and model in lab2013/FSS/20130908

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{70}{1+\imath f/146}
\label{eq:Hmodel}
\end{equation}

We actually interpolate the data for this block, so that we don't run into trouble in the discrepancy region.

\subsection{T}

This is a SR560 that operates between the Trap Servo control signal and the analog drive for the large optic OSEMs.

It is currently set to a 1KHz 6db lowpass with a gain of 200, so it is modeled as 

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{200}{1 - \imath f/1\mbox{KHz}}
\label{eq:T}
\end{equation}						



\section{Photothermal effect on loops}
The photothermal effect is directly related to how close the cavity is to resonance. This is affected by the total cavity length and the frequency of the light entering the cavity. In figure \ref{fig:photothermal_blocks}, we see that the photothermal effect (Pt) can be treated as a closed loop acting on the cavity length $L_{cav}$.
