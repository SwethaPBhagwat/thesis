  abstract = { In this article, we highlight some of the problems inherent in fielding an atom interferometer sensor, specifically an atom interferometer gradient magnetometer of the type recently proposed [Davis, J.P.; Narducci, F.A. J. Mod. Opt. 2008, 55, 3173â€“3185]. In particular, we focus on the problems created by stray magnetic fields. We review some of the quantum optic techniques to measure local magnetic fields for the purpose of nulling them. We also present our implementation of a technique to non-destructively measure the temperature of an atom cloud. We highlight our implementation of these techniques and present our measurements. }
