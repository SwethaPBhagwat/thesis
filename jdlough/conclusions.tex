I have shown that the optical trap works for one degree of freedom and
matches well with the theory if we include the effects due to thermal
expansion.
This thermal expansion effect adds an interesting contribution to the transfer
function. Unfortunately, this effect works against us to destabilize the mirror.

This discovery indicates that we will have to balance the power density with
absorption limits for the optics in order to make this work in future
gravitational wave detectors.
