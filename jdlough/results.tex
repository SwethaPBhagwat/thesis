Linear trap measurements have been taken twice.
The first measurement was with the subcarrier at the same offset frequency from
the carrier for each measurement.
The results generally were in line with the theory, however there were
complications with the layout that we felt should be improved on.

The first set of measurements seemed to have a large drift.
One of the reasons for this is the fact that the carrier beam was not
well aligned to the subcarrier beam causing drifts in the power ratio between
carrier and subcarrier as the overall alignment drifted.
Another complication in the first run was due to the fact that the carrier and
subcarrier beams had exactly the same polarizations which caused a strong
beat signal at $355kH\!z$. This beat signal was low enough in frequency that
it would show strongly in the resonant \ac{rfpd} output, likely causing
saturation effects in the electronics that would lead to an unpredictable
subcarrier detuning.
Despite these issues we were clearly able to observe
stable and unstable optical springs and there was a short stretch of
measurements that seem that line up with the model with certain assumptions
about the parameter space.

\section{Experimental Layout Revision}
From our first layout design there was a rather
large beat signal on the \ac{rfpd} used for generating the \ac{pdh} signal
for our locking feedback servo.
This beat signal is a result of our initial layout involving the combining of
carrier and subcarrier beams before the \ac{fi} which resulted in the two beams
having the same polarization.
This produces a beat signal of the difference in the two frequencies.
The beat signal shows up in our resonant \ac{rfpd} because we use a small
frequency offset.
We feared there could be saturations in the photodiode electronics that would
cause unpredictable electronic offsets in the trap locking feedback servo
resulting in an error on the subcarrier detuning lock point.
