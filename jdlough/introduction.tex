explain where h(t) comes from. What creates these perturbations.

\section{Angular Control Using Optical Traps}

In Advanced LIGO we use an active feedback control for angular alignment of
the main mirrors.
We are limited in this setup by sensing noise.
By using optical traps we can bypass this limitation.

The sensing is done with a technique called wavefront sensing.
It is basically a \ac{pdh} lock with quadrant photo-diodes measuring
the differential \ac{pdh} signal from opposite quadrants of the photo-diode.
