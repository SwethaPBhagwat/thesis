\section{Gravitational Waves}

The foundation of Einstein's theory of general relativity is that the motion
of a freely falling body is governed by the local space-time curvature.
This curvature is in turn influenced by the presence of
matter.
% \footnote{matter being stuff that has mass}.
This matter not only curves the space it occupies, but also curves the space
around it.
% in such a way as to result in an acceleration on an object given by,
% \begin{equation}
% a = \frac{GM}{r^2} \;.
% \end{equation}

As matter moves through space, the curvature of space changes.
%Not only is the curvature changing in the space in which the matter is
%moving, it is also changing away from the mass.
Special relativity tells us that information cannot travel faster than the
speed of light.
The information about how the curvature of space is changing must propagate
at finite speed.
From the multipole expansion of the mass distribution, the monopole (which is
the first term) is a scalar quantity that is simply the total
mass of the object.
The second term is, called the 'dipole' is a vector which is the sum of all the
bits of mass multiplied by their position vector from a fixed reference point.
The dipole term is identically the center of mass location times the total mass.
This term can change with time, however the first derivative $mv$ (momentum)
is conserved.
The third term is known as the quadrupole term.
It is this term which has a non zero second derivative that gives rise to a
wave equation.
And the amplitude of this gravitational wave is,
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{2G}{c^4r}\ddot I \;,
\end{equation}
where the unitless term $h$ is the gravitational wave strain.
This strain is the $\frac{\Delta L}{L}$ perturbation on the background
space-time metric that we are looking for.
Gravitational waves stretch space-time in one
direction while squeezing it in the orthogonal direction.



We look for the strain perturbations by measuring the distance between two
freely falling objects we call test masses.
In the simple case of a two test mass detector (one arm of LIGO) we are only
sensitive to half of the signal (assuming optimal orientation).
Since the orthogonal direction is moving in the opposite way, it would be
natural to choose an instrument which measures the difference in length between
two orthogonal directions.
%makes a differential length detector
%a natural choice
And with two orthogonal arms we are sensitive to the full
amplitude of the wave.
It is important to note that this factor of 2 increase in the signal, though
helpful, is not the primary motivation for two arms. 
The big benefit comes from common noise cancellation.
We can cancel out common length noise in the two arms because the gravitational
wave will couple directly into the differential degree of freedom in the
detector. See figure \ref{fig:ligoschematic}.

%\section{Angular Control Using Optical Traps}

\section{Angular Control}

In order for our instrument to be sensitive to gravitational waves we want
the test masses to swing freely.
Also, since the gravitational wave amplitude is a strain and we are measuring
changes in length, we get better sensitivity with longer arms.
Longer arms, however, also make it more difficult to keep the mirrors pointed
at each other.
An angular control system is necessary for the sensitive alignment of the
instrument.

In Advanced LIGO we use an active feedback control for angular alignment of
the main mirrors\cite{aligowfs}.
%which is discussed in more detail in the angular instability section of our
%theory paper which is provided in \ref{sec:IV}.
Sensing for this feedback is done with a technique known as wavefront sensing.
The beam entering a cavity is phase modulated to produce sidebands.
The phase modulation is done at a high enough frequency so that almost all
of the sideband beams are reflected.

  }
  \label{fig:sbreflang}
\end{figure}


Wavefront sensing works by beating the carrier beam reflected from the cavity
against the reflected sidebands.
Any misalignment results in a 1st order mode component of the reflected carrier
beam relative to the reflected sidebands.
This effect is shown in figure \ref{fig:sbreflang}.
If we were to then integrate over the transverse dimensions using a photodiode,
the beat signal would produce no amplitude since we are beating together
orthogonal transverse modes.
We can defeat this by splitting the photodiode in two and measuring the
difference between the two sides.

I will illustrate this effect using bra-ket notation.
Keeping things to first order, the reflected carrier beam is composed of the
$\mathrm{TEM}_{00}$ mode with a small amount of the $\mathrm{TEM}_{10}$ mode,
\begin{align}
  \left| \mathrm{CC} \right\rangle &\approx \left| 00 \right\rangle + \eta
    \left| 10 \right\rangle \\
  &= \left| 00 \right\rangle + \eta \left| 00 \right\rangle \frac{2x}{w(z)}
    e^{i\Psi(z)} \; .
\end{align}
The $\mathrm{TEM}_{00}$ mode from the sidebands looks like,
\begin{align}
  \left| \mathrm{SB} \right\rangle &= \left| 00 \right\rangle \cos
    \Omega t \; .
\end{align}
The combined beam in reflection looks like,
\begin{equation}
  \left| \mathrm{REFL} \right\rangle = \left| \mathrm{CC} \right\rangle +
    \left| \mathrm{SB} \right\rangle \; .
\end{equation}

Now, we apply our sensing operator, $\mathrm{PD}$. If $\mathrm{PD}$ is simply
a single photodiode, we get,
\begin{align}
  \left\langle \mathrm{REFL} \left| \mathrm{PD} \right| \mathrm{REFL}
  \right\rangle &= \left\langle 00 | 00 \right\rangle
    \left( 1 + \cos \Omega t \right)^2 +
    2\eta \braket{00}{10} \left(1 + \cos \Omega t \right) +
    \eta^2 \braket{10}{10}
\end{align}
The term which is first order in $\Omega$ will vanish due to orthonormality.
We can defeat this by splitting our photodiode in two and subtracting one side
from the other.
% Then, the $\ket{10}$ field changes from odd to even and the
Now, the integral $\braopket{00}{\mathrm{PD}}{10}$ is no longer zero.
If the photodiode is perfectly aligned with the transverse mode basis,
the integrals $\braopket{00}{\mathrm{PD}}{00}$ and
$\braopket{10}{\mathrm{PD}}{10}$ become zero.

%We will demodulate with the $\Omega$ local oscillator signal. So, with
%$\mathrm{PD}$ as our sensing operator 

%Adding the two beams and then integrating the power across a photodiode gives
%us,
%\begin{align}
%  \left| \mathrm{REFL} \right\rangle &= \left| 00 \right\rangle
%    \left( \cos \Omega t + \frac{2x}{w(z)} e^{i \Psi (z)} \right)^2 \; .
%\end{align}

%%%%%%
% The beat signal is demodulated to give the error signal.

The non zero beat signal is then demodulated to give us the error signal.


%%%%%%
% The gouy phase allows for an additional degree of freedom in the signal.

From the longitudinal dimension of the wave, we get an additional phase degree
of freedom. There is a Gouy phase term which depends on the distance from the waist
of the beam. The Gouy phase, $\Psi(z)$, is defined by
\begin{align*}
  \tan{\Psi(z)} = z/z_R \;,
\end{align*}
where $z_R$ is the Rayleigh range which is defined as the distance from the beam
waist to the point where the beam radius increases by $\sqrt{2}$.

%%%%%%
% The input test mass and end test mass are at different gouy phases, allowing
% us to sense the alignment degree of freedom for each mirror.

Since the input test mass and end test mass are at different Gouy phases
their misalignment affects a different linear combination of quadratures of the
beam.

%%%%%%
% The idea can be applied to the y-dimension as well to give the two alignment
% degrees of freedom (pitch and yaw)

Splitting the photodiode into four quadrants gives us sensitivity to two
alignment degrees of freedom.

%%%%%%
%
%

We use two quadrant photodiodes for sensing the four angular degrees
of freedom of the two cavity mirrors.
The two \ac{qpd}s are placed in reflection at different distances from the
input mirror for sensing the different Gouy phases.
Then we can transform the four degrees of freedom of the sensor output to the
four degrees of freedom of the mirror alignments.

%This is picked up in a RF quadrant photodiode and demodulated with the local
%oscillator for the sidebands placed on the beam producing a \ac{pdh}
%style error signal for pitch and yaw.


\subsection{Limitations}

%Angular control is necessary to stabilize the Sidles-Sigg instability
%\cite{2006PhLA..354..167S}.

%%%%%%
% There are limitations to this approach which ultimately amount to adding
% noise into the sensitive band of the detector
%
There are limitations to this approach which will ultimately add
noise into the sensitive band of the detector.
This noise comes from the alignment sensing which gets fed back to the
alignment actuators and couples into the gravitational wave strain signal.
% A couple of important limitations come from this technique.

The coupling of angular motion to gravitational wave strain occurs due to
misalignment of the beam on the test masses as well as unbalanced actuation
on the test masses.

%First, we need some
%light to make this work. At the light port there is plenty, but at the dark
%port we need all of the light we can get for the DC readout where we get the
%gravitational wave signal from.
%The feedback can easily be limited by sensing noise since there is very little
%light to work with.

%The second limitation is that for angular stabilization
The ability to attenuate the sensing signal is limited by the fact that
we need to control above the hard mode frequency of the Sidles-Sigg instability
\cite{2006PhLA..354..167S}
which,
for Advanced LIGO at high power, is at about 6 Hz.
We need a sharp cutoff in the feedback below 10Hz in order to not introduce
sensing noise in the sensitive band of LIGO.
There is very little room to attenuate the sensing noise sufficiently above 10
Hz while keeping a stable feedback loop with a unity gain frequency above 6 Hz.


At some point, as we push for better sensitivity in the low frequency regime,
there will be a tradeoff between going to higher power in the
interferometer and reducing WFS sensing noise coupling to the gravitational
wave strain measurement at low frequencies.
As power is increased, the frequency of the hard mode of the angular
instability increases by $\sqrt{\mathrm{P}}$.
The sensing noise contribution must also increase by $\sqrt{\mathrm{P}}$
where the feedback transfer function falls off as $1/f$.
Where the feedback has a steep cutoff, $1/f^\mathrm{n}$, the sensing noise
contribution must increase by $\sqrt{\mathrm{P^n}}$.
Likewise, the radiation pressure noise increases by $\sqrt{\mathrm{P}}$.
The sensing noise will therefore overtake the radiation pressure noise as the
laser power increases.

%It is basically a \ac{pdh} lock with quadrant photo-diodes measuring
%the differential \ac{pdh} signal from opposite quadrants of the photo-diode.
