\subsection{Measure the optical losses up to the cavity}

\subsection{Calibration of carrier and subcarrier photodiodes}
We will calibrate the photodiodes while the cavity is not locked, knowing the incident beam power and the round trip losses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Block carrier light in Mach-Zehnder path.
    \item Turn the reflection monitor beam half-wave plate to minimize subcarrier light on the photodiode.
    \item Block the reflection monitor beam to measure dark voltage at DCPD ($A$).
    \item Unblock the reflection monitor beam and measure voltage at DCPD ($B$).
    \item Unblock the carrier light and measure again ($C$)
    \item Block subcarrier light and measure the carrier power using power meter after last steering mirror on table 1 ($D$).
    \item Using the measured optical loss to the cavity ($L$) compute the mW/mV calibration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\frac{D\cdot L}{C - B}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
