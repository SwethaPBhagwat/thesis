\section{Experimental Layout}
Using the beam from our laser (see \ref{ch:psl}) we split into two orthogonal
polarizations. One beam we need to be at a higher power with positive detuning
(statically stable and dynamically unstable) we call the carrier beam. The
beam with less power and negative detuning we call the subcarrier.

The subcarrier optical path consists of a pair of \ac{aom}s that we use to
detune the subcarrier relative to the carrier beam.
There is also a resonant
\ac{eom} which is used to impart sidebands on the subcarrier beam for \ac{pdh}
locking.
The carrier and subcarrier are then combined using a \ac{pbs} to preserve their
orthogonal polarizations. There is a beamsplitter in the subcarrier path to pick
off the reflected light from the cavity which is used to generate the \ac{pdh}
signal. There are additional $\lambda/2$ and $\lambda/4$ waveplates at various
points in the path for polarization optimization.

\subsection{Subcarrier Servo}
Because of our short cavity length we have a large \ac{fsr} in frequency of
about 2.14GHz.
This produces a technical problem in attempting to set the
subcarrier on the next resonance, one \ac{fsr} away.
\ac{aom}s are limited in the range of frequencies they can operate in.
The minimum is higher than the linewidth for our cavity.
The maximum is less than \ac{fsr}.

The solution for us was to set the subcarrier on the same resonance fringe
using two \ac{aom}s, each one shifting the frequency by about 80MHz in
opposite directions.
One is driven by a crystal oscillator.
The other is driven by a tunable oscillator, a \ac{vco}, which gives us the
knob to detune the subcarrier.

We produce a beat signal between the two oscillators and we lock the beat
signal to a function generator operating in the range of frequencies we are
need to detune the subcarrier with. So, now we can set directly, the carrier
to subcarrier offset frequency using the knob on the function generator.
This setup essentially eliminates frequency noise due to the crystal
oscillator, which is quite low to begin with, since we are subtracting the
same, coherent, frequency noise with the second \ac{aom}.
And the frequency noise due to the function generator is lower due to the
fact that we are using a lower frequency tunable oscillator.
Tunable oscillators generally have a frequency noise that is relative to the
set frequency.

\section{Features of Experiment}
\subsection{High Finesse}
We need a high finesse cavity to give us the power buildup in the cavity that
we need for a decent resonant frequency to get beyond some environmental noise.
Ignoring any damping effects a fairly straight-forward calculation gives the
resonant frequency we can achieve for a given finesse and input power. For a
high finesse, it can be shown that the maximum spring constant for a given
power is approximately,
\begin{align}
k &= \frac{18 F^2}{\sqrt{12} \pi \lambda c} P
\end{align}
which gives a maximum resonant frequency of,
\begin{align}
f_0 &= \frac{F}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{18 P}{\sqrt{12} \pi \lambda m c }} \\
&\approx 3.8kHz
\end{align}

\subsection{Short Cavity}
The short cavity gives us a reduction in the frequency noise contribution
to the noise budget. This reduction scales as the cavity length. This also
affects the free spectral range, however, and with our finesse, the cavity
pole is about 140kHz.

\section{High-Q Payload Suspension}

In designing the suspension for the small mirror we went through the thermal
noise analysis to determine the best approach. We wanted to suspend the small
mirror using thin glass fibers with a low tension for isolating the mass from
vibrations in the next mass up in the chain.

The initial thermal noise analysis was for the glue used to mount the glass
fibers to the small mirror. This analysis is described in detail in the
noise chapter. We designed the glue joints of the suspension to minimize
thermal noise based on the analysis. The result of the analysis was to have a
small mass at the glue end of the fiber with a center of gravity close to the
glue surface.

\subsection{Monolithic Welding}

We began by gaining experience with welding fibers. In doing so, we decided it
should not be too difficult to weld the fibers directly to the small mirror.
This actually proved to be more difficult than anticipated.
The first attempt at welding a mirror damaged the coating quite visibly even
though we were careful to shield the coating surface by clamping the mirror
with quartz tubes.

After making several improvements to the welding stand, we welded a mirror
with no visible damage to the coating, however once installed, we found the
finesse to be too low.
The mirror was welded, suspended, and placed in vacuum system
for assembly of the cavity.
After careful alignment we found the finesse to be about 700, much lower than
desired.
Since this was the cavity output mirror that was damaged, it dramatically
affected the performance of the experiment.
The power buildup in the cavity is dependent on the
individual cavity mirror reflectivities.

\subsection{Glued Fiber Attachements}

The final suspension design for this experiment used small cone-shaped glass
nubs at the glue end of the fibers. This could be constructed monolithicaly
by cold welding\footnote{a process where the substrate is not heated to the
point where the materials flow together} the tip of a glass rod to a small
mirror blank\footnote{or a mirror with a previously damaged coating...} to
create a small nub from which the fiber is pulled. This is all done in one
continuous motion where the torch is applied to the edge of the mirror to
gently heat the point of attachement, then the rod with a sharp point is placed
into the flame to melt the tip and cold weld to the edge of the mirror. The
flame is then directed at the tip of the rod slightly back from the weld to
soften the fiber pull spot. When the spot is sufficiently heated, the fiber
is pulled away sharply while dropping the flame away from the fiber. What
remains is a rod attached to a small conical shaped nub monolithically through
a very thin, high Q fiber. Now the cold weld allows us to separate this
monolithic fiber assembly because the bond strength is much less than the yield
strength of the fiber. We then glue this monolithic fiber assembly using the
epoxy to the side of the mirror with undamaged coatings. This technique allows
us to preserve a very high Q (~$5x10^5$) while avoiding damage to the coating.

\subsection{Double Pendulum}
The output mirror is suspended by glass fibers inside a ring of steel which is
three inches in diameter. The steel ring is the \ac{sos} controlled mass.
Since the mass of the ring is considerably greater than the mass of the small
mirror, the transfer function for force to position on the small mirror can be
approximated by simply the small mirror mass and resonant frequency.
For the complete solution, the equations of motion that need to be solved for
one dimension are,

\section{Locking Challenges}

\subsection{Optical Lever}
We found the small mirror resonances to be strong enough to prevent locking the
trapping cavity. Our solution to this was to employ an optical lever, where a
laser is reflected off the back of the small mirror and onto a quadrant
photodiode. The photodiode outputs a signal corresponding to the pitch and yaw
of the small mirror. If you aren't careful with the position of lenses, there
will be a coupling of the small mirror position to the photodiode signals.
We took advantage of our carelessness and used the coupled position signal
to feedback through resonant gain filters in the digital system and applied to
the OSEM drives of the SOS.

\section{Actuation Range}
Due to seismic noise we needed a fairly wide actuation range at low frequencies.
The maximum range of the laser PZT is plus or minus 160MHz. This corresponds to
about 42nm. We needed another actuation path to extend the range at low
frequencies. For this we use the magnetic force from the OSEM coils.
Additionally, due to the high finesse, we needed a fairly high bandwidth for
the feedback loop. The high voltage amplifier for the laser PZT itself has a
bandwidth limit, so we needed a high-frequency bypass which passively adds the
HV output to the HV input.

\section{Sub-Carrier Servo}
As mentioned above, we needed a way of shifting the frequency of the subcarrier
beam in relation to the carrier by $\mathcal{O}\, 100\, kH\!z$.
We do this using \ac{aom}s by first shifting in one direction by $80\,MH\!z$,
then shifting the opposite direction by $80\,MH\!z + \mathrm{offset}$.
The $80\,MH\!z$ frequency source is a crystal oscillator. The variable
frequency source is a \ac{vco} which uses the output of a feedack servo to
modulate the frequency. The sensor for this feedback is the demodulated beat
signal of the output of the two \ac{aom} frequency sources. The demodulation
is done by mixing the beat signal with the output of a function generator which
is set to the desired offset frequency.

\section{Procedures}

\subsection{Measure the optical losses up to the cavity}

\subsection{Calibration of carrier and subcarrier photodiodes}
We will calibrate the photodiodes while the cavity is not locked, knowing the incident beam power and the round trip losses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Block carrier light in Mach-Zehnder path.
    \item Turn the reflection monitor beam half-wave plate to minimize subcarrier light on the photodiode.
    \item Block the reflection monitor beam to measure dark voltage at DCPD ($A$).
    \item Unblock the reflection monitor beam and measure voltage at DCPD ($B$).
    \item Unblock the carrier light and measure again ($C$)
    \item Block subcarrier light and measure the carrier power using power meter after last steering mirror on table 1 ($D$).
    \item Using the measured optical loss to the cavity ($L$) compute the mW/mV calibration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\frac{D\cdot L}{C - B}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Mode Matching}
We want to know how much power couples into the cavity from a
perfectly gaussian beam of the wrong size and location. We start with
the equations for the Hermite-Gaussian beam decomposition as discussed in
Siegman \cite{Siegman86}. 

\newcommand{\intinfxy}[1]{\int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} #1 \,dx \,dy}
\newcommand{\intinfrt}[1]{\int^{2 \pi}_{0} \int^{\infty}_{0} #1 r \,dr \,d\theta}


\begin{align}
    c_{nm} &= \intinfxy{
    E(x,y,z) u_n^*(x,z)u_m^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{
    E(x,y,z) u_0^*(x,z)u_0^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{
    u_0(x,z-z_0)u_0(y,z-z_0) u_0^*(x,z)u_0^*(y,z)}
\end{align}

We now assign the labels $b$ for the beam and $c$ for the cavity,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \intinfxy{
    u_{b0}(x,z-z_0)u_{b0}(y,z-z_0) u_{c0}^*(x,z)u_{c0}^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w^2_0} \right) \left( \frac{q_{b0}}{q_{b}(z)} \right)
    \left( \frac{q^*_{c0}}{q^*_{c}(z)} \right) \exp \left[-ik \left( x^2 + y^2  \right)
    \left( \frac{1}{2q_b(z)} + \frac{1}{2q^*_c(z)} \right) \right]}
\end{align}

Since $q(z) = q_0 + z - z_0$, and $q_0$ is purely imaginary,


\begin{multline}
    c_{00} = \intinfxy{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \\
    \exp \left[
    \frac{-ik \left( x^2 + y^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \right]}
\end{multline}

We start by changing to cylindrical coordinates,

\begin{multline}
    c_{00} = \intinfrt{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \\
    \exp \left[
    \frac{-ik \left( r^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \right]}
\end{multline}

A careful analysis of the exponent will reveal that the real part must be less than $0$.
We can therefore solve the Gaussian integral, setting $s =
\frac{-ik \left( r^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
$,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \intinfrt{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \exp \left[ s
    \right]} \nonumber
\\  &= \int^{\infty}_{0} \left( \frac{4}{w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \exp \left[ s
    \right] r \,dr
\end{align}

Now we transform the differential and the limits of integration, remembering
that the real part of $s$ is less than $0$, $ds =
-ik \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) r \,dr
$,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \int^{0}_{-\infty} e^s \,ds \nonumber
\\  &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \nonumber
\\  &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+q_{c0}-z_0)} \right)
\end{align}

Now, we rewrite the coefficient in terms of waist sizes and distance between waists, using,
\begin{align*}
    q_0 &= \frac{i \pi w_0^2}{\lambda}
\\  k &= 2 \pi / \lambda
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \frac{2 w_{b0} w_{c0}}{w_{b0}^2 + w_{c0}^2 + i z_0 \lambda / \pi} \nonumber
\\  &= \frac{2 w_{b0} / w_{c0}}{1 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + i z_0 / z_R}
\end{align}

Power coupling into cavity is then (assuming no loss and $r_1 = r_2$),

%\begin{align}
%    P_{mathrm{trans}} &= P_{mathrm{incident}} \frac{}{}
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
    P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4 w_{b0}^2 / w_{c0}^2}{1 +
    2 \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^4 + \left(
    z_0 / z_R \right)^2} \nonumber
\\  P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4}{ 2 + \left( w_{c0} /
    w_{b0} \right)^2 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left(
    z_0 / z_R \right)^2}
\\  P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4}{ \left( w_{c0} /
    w_{b0} + w_{b0} / w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left( z_0 / z_R \right)^2}
    \label{symetricmatch}
\end{align}

In equation \ref{symetricmatch} we can see readily the symmetry between
$w_{b0}$ and $w_{c0}$, and the symmetry of $z_0$ about $0$, as expected.
