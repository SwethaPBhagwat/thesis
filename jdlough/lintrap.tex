% We are targeting an optical spring frequency of about 1kHz because this
% about where we can operate given limited budget for seismic isolation.
% With a 2watt laser and finesse of ~10k we constrain the mass to be no more
% than...
%

% optical spring frequency choice

We want our optical spring frequency to be high enough so the experiment is
not limited by seismic noise.
Without the resources for elaborate seismic isolation we are limited to single
pendulum isolation stages with a natural frequency of order 1Hz.
At 1kHz we have seismic motion below $10^{-12} \mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$.
With a pendulum isolation we can attenuate at 1kHz by a factor of $10^{-6}$.
Assuming we have a cavity length of order 30cm we can assume a corresponding
frequency noise of about $1 \mathrm{mHz/\sqrt{Hz}}$.
This is well below the free running laser noise of the NPRO laser of about
$10\mathrm{Hz/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 1kHz.

% how to get optical spring frequency

To achieve this resonant frequency we will need to have a small mass.
Just how small is determined by the $\mathrm{dP/dL}$ dependance that gives
us the optical spring constant.
For a high finesse, it can be shown, by taking the derivative of the
intracavity power,
that the maximum spring constant for a given power is approximately
\begin{align}
k &= \frac{3^{5/2} F^2}{\pi \lambda c} P \,.
\end{align}
This gives us a minimum mass of
\begin{align}
m &= 3^{5/2} \frac{F^2}{\pi \lambda c \omega^2_0} P \, .
\end{align}
% which gives a maximum resonant frequency of
% \begin{align}
% f_0 &= \frac{F}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{18 P}{\sqrt{12} \pi \lambda m c }} \\
% &\approx 3.8kHz \,.
% \end{align}
% The frequency in the last step was arrived at by using a finesse of 8200
% with a reasonable input power of 1 Watt.


%
% Need high q suspension for small optic in order for the spring stability to be
% dominated by the optical field.
%

Additionally, we need a high Q suspension for the small optic in order for the
spring stability to be dominated by the optical field.
The optical spring will have fairly low phase since we will be operating a
frequency much lower than the cavity pole.



%
% Frequency noise will dominate experiment.
% We can reduce the effect of frequency noise by using a shorter cavity.
%

We use a smaller cavity in order to reduce the effect of frequency noise.
The frequency noise couples in by the ratio of the cavity length and
laser frequency.


%
% With a negative g-factor we get stable angular modes assuming the other
% mass is heavy.
%

As described in section  if we choose a sufficiently heavy mass for the
input mirror, the angular stability of the small mass is governed by the
following relationship,
\begin{align}
T &= \frac{F_0 L}{1 - g_1 g_2} g_1 \theta
\end{align}
By choosing negative g-factors we get the stable angular mode for the small
mirror since the large mirror is essentially fixed.

% This is statically stable, what about dynamic instability due to the cavity
% delay?

%
% Goal for experiment was low noise so that we could turn off active feedback.
%

Ultimately, we wanted to lower the frequency impact of frequency noise, so we
chose a short cavity.
Since the linewidth of the resonance is fixed in terms of cavity length
$ ( \mathrm{FWHM}(m) = \lambda / \mathcal{F} ) $ it is
natural to convert the frequency noise to cavity length.
The cavity length noise is related to the frequency noise by,
\begin{align}
\delta L &= \delta f \frac{L}{f} \, .
\end{align}
By using a shorter cavity, we reduce the effect of frequency noise by geometry
alone.

The cavity length is related to the radius of curvature by the fact that we want
negative g-factors, which constrains the length to 1 to 2 times the radius of
curvature (for the case $g_1 = g_2$).
With the off the shelf substrates available at the time, we chose to use a 5cm
radius of curvature for both input and output mirror.

Incedentally, the sizes of the mirrors available with a 5cm radius of curvature
are quite small.
We chose the smallest one for the output mirror, which gave us a payload mass of
about 0.41 grams, well within our criteria for optical spring resonance frequency.

In order to avoid higher order modes near the resonance we examined the resonance
condition for the first ten orders.
We determined that with a radius of curvature of 5cm, we could avoid these modes
well with a cavity length of 7cm.

These criteria lead us to the experimental parameters listed in table
\ref{tab:lintrap1}.


% Our goal, ultimately, is to demonstrate the angular optical trap described in
% chapter \ref{ch:theory}.
% To get there we need to develop the tools and techniques for generating the
% one-dimensional optical trap.

% The one-dimensional trap has been done before at MIT \cite{Corbitt07}.
% In that experiment they were limited by laser frequency noise.
% Since the frequency noise couples into the experiment by $\frac{L \lambda}{c}$,
% we could improve the frequency noise just by shortening the cavity.

% In choosing a cavity length, we had to balance several factors. We wanted it to
% be short. We had limitations on how close we could get the suspension towers.
% We also wanted to keep a negative $g$ factor, defined by
% \begin{equation}
% g = 1-\frac{L}{R} \;,
% \end{equation}
% in order to avoid Sidles Sigg
% instablity since we are by design operating in a radiation pressure dominated
% regime.
% And finally, we wanted to avoid overlap of higher order modes on the TEM00 mode.

%For the experiment to work, we need to be able to push on the mirror with the
%radiation pressure of the laser.
%For this, we wanted a light mirror suspended in some way to allow it to move.
%Additionally, we need to filter out some background seismic noise in the
%region of the experiment.
%We can do this by suspending each mirror in a pendulum.
%This works well for noise supression at higher frequencies, but hanging a
%pendulum from very thin wires creates a sharp resonance peak in the transfer
%function, meaning that the motion of the mirror will look like a very large
%amplitude sine with a frequency of $\sqrt{g/l}/2\pi$.
%We need a way of damping the motion while giving us the ability to align the
%cavity mirrors.
%Fortunately, the design for such a device exists already for use in LIGO to
%suspend and control some of the smaller optics in the instrument.
%With a bit of modification the LIGO \ac{sos} was exactly what we needed.

%So, we built these structures and borrowed some of the more complicated parts
%from friends.\footnote{It's nice to be in a collaboration}
%Figure \ref{fig:susbig} shows what one of the suspension towers we use looked
%like before the modification described in
%Figure \ref{fig:blades}.

  tower.

  We modified the tower base in order to get the mirrors closer together.
  You can see in this picture the base is flush with the front of the
  vertical side plates.
  This suspension was modified after first cavity lock to further improve
  seismic isolation using blade springs depicted in figure \ref{fig:blades}.
  The extra length of cabling is for suspending the OSEM connection block
  in case the entire platform is suspended as an extra level of seismic
  isolation.
  In this case, suspending the connection block may be desirable to reduce
  seismic coupling to the platform through the stiff vacuum cabling.

%small mass. The details of which are described in section \ref{sec:highQsus}.

  This was necessary for additional bounce mode suppression of seismic noise.
  The bounce mode of the suspension wires were at about 22Hz.
  This unfortunately, was very close to a peak in our seismic spectrum
  resulting in too much vertical motion in our suspended mirrors.
  With the addition of the blade springs, we ended up with a bounce mode of
  about 7Hz providing more supression of the seismic by moving away from a
  seismic peak as well as the additional suppression from a lower frequency
  mode. See section \ref{sec:seismic}.

\section{Experimental Layout}
Using the beam from our laser (ch.\ref{ch:psl}) we split into two orthogonal
polarizations. One beam we need to be at a higher power with positive detuning
(statically stable and dynamically unstable) we call the carrier beam. The
beam with less power and negative detuning we call the subcarrier.

The subcarrier optical path (fig.\ref{fig:scservo}) consists of a pair of \ac{aom}s that we use to
detune the subcarrier relative to the carrier beam.
There is also a resonant
\ac{eom} which is used to impart sidebands on the subcarrier beam for \ac{pdh}
locking.
The carrier and subcarrier are then combined using a \ac{pbs} to preserve their
orthogonal polarizations. There is a beamsplitter in the subcarrier path to pick
off the reflected light from the cavity which is used to generate the \ac{pdh}
signal. There are additional $\lambda/2$ and $\lambda/4$ waveplates at various
points in the path for polarization optimization.

%\subsection{Subcarrier Servo}
Because of our short cavity length we have a large \ac{fsr} in frequency of
about 2.14GHz.
This produces a technical problem in attempting to set the
subcarrier on the next resonance, one \ac{fsr} away.
\ac{aom}s are limited in the range of frequencies they can operate in.
The minimum is higher than the linewidth for our cavity.
The maximum is less than \ac{fsr}.

The solution for us was to set the subcarrier on the same resonance fringe
using two \ac{aom}s, each one shifting the frequency by about 80MHz in
opposite directions.
One is driven by a crystal oscillator.
The other is driven by a tunable oscillator, a \ac{vco}, which gives us the
knob to detune the subcarrier.

We produce a beat signal between the two oscillators and we lock the beat
signal to a function generator operating in the range of frequencies we are
need to detune the subcarrier with. So, now we can set directly, the carrier
to subcarrier offset frequency using the knob on the function generator.
This setup essentially eliminates frequency noise due to the crystal
oscillator, which is quite low to begin with, since we are subtracting the
same, coherent, frequency noise with the second \ac{aom}.
And the frequency noise due to the function generator is lower due to the
fact that we are using a lower frequency tunable oscillator.
Tunable oscillators generally have a frequency noise that is relative to the
set frequency.
The subcarrier servo is discussed in more detail in section
\ref{sec:scservo}.

\section{Features of Experiment}
\subsection{High Finesse}
We need a high finesse cavity to give us the power buildup in the cavity that
we need for a decent resonant frequency to get beyond some environmental noise.
Ignoring any damping effects a fairly straight-forward calculation gives the
resonant frequency we can achieve for a given finesse and input power. For a
high finesse, it can be shown, by taking the derivative of the intracavity power,
that the maximum spring constant for a given power is approximately
\begin{align}
k &= \frac{18 F^2}{\sqrt{12} \pi \lambda c} P \,,
\end{align}
which gives a maximum resonant frequency of
\begin{align}
f_0 &= \frac{F}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{18 P}{\sqrt{12} \pi \lambda m c }} \\
&\approx 3.8kHz \,.
\end{align}
The frequency in the last step was arrived at by using a finesse of 8200
with a reasonable input power of 1 Watt.

\subsection{Short Cavity}
\label{sec:lin_short}
The short cavity gives us a reduction in the frequency noise contribution
to the noise budget. This reduction scales as the cavity length. This also
affects the free spectral range, however, and with our finesse, the cavity
pole is about 140kHz.

\section{High-Q Payload Suspension}
\label{sec:highQsus}
In designing the suspension for the small mirror we went through the thermal
noise analysis to determine the best approach. We wanted to suspend the small
mirror using thin glass fibers with a low tension for isolating the mass from
vibrations in the next mass up in the chain.
Thin fused silica fibers are desirable for seismic isolation suspension due to
the very high quality factor acheivable. \cite{Ageev}

The initial thermal noise analysis was for the glue used to mount the glass
fibers to the small mirror. This analysis is described in detail in the
noise chapter. We designed the glue joints of the suspension to minimize
thermal noise based on the analysis. The result of the analysis was to have a
small mass at the glue end of the fiber with a center of gravity close to the
glue surface.

\subsection{Monolithic Welding}

We began by gaining experience with welding fibers. In doing so, we decided it
should not be too difficult to weld the fibers directly to the small mirror.
This actually proved to be more difficult than anticipated.
The first attempt at welding a mirror damaged the coating quite visibly even
though we were careful to shield the coating surface by clamping the mirror
with quartz tubes.

After making several improvements to the welding stand, we welded a mirror
with no visible damage to the coating, however once installed, we found the
finesse to be too low.
The mirror was welded, suspended, and placed in vacuum system
for assembly of the cavity.
After careful alignment we found the finesse to be about 700, much lower than
desired.
Since this was the cavity output mirror that was damaged, it dramatically
affected the performance of the experiment.
The power buildup in the cavity is dependent on the
individual cavity mirror reflectivities.

\subsection{Glued Fiber Attachements}

The final suspension design for this experiment used small cone-shaped glass
nubs at the glue end of the fibers.
This could be constructed monolithicaly
by cold welding\footnote{a process where the substrate is not heated to the
point where the materials flow together} the tip of a glass rod to a small
mirror blank\footnote{or a mirror with a previously damaged coating...} to
create a small nub from which the fiber is pulled.
This is all done in one
continuous motion where the torch is applied to the edge of the mirror to
gently heat the point of attachement, then the rod with a sharp point is placed
into the flame to melt the tip and cold weld to the edge of the mirror.
The
flame is then directed at the tip of the rod slightly back from the weld to
soften the fiber pull spot.
When the spot is sufficiently heated, the fiber
is pulled away sharply while dropping the flame away from the fiber.
What
remains is a rod attached to a small conical shaped nub monolithically through
a very thin, high Q fiber.
Now the cold weld allows us to separate this
monolithic fiber assembly because the bond strength is much less than the yield
strength of the fiber.

We then glue this monolithic fiber assembly using the epoxy to the side of the
mirror with undamaged coatings.
This technique allows us to preserve a very high Q ($\approx 5\times 10^5$)
while avoiding damage to the coating.
The results of a Q ringdown measurement can be seen in
figure \ref{fig:Qmeasurement}.

\caption[Q Measurement of Glass Suspension]{
    This ringdown measurement was done by exciting the $\approx 18\mathrm{Hz}$
    position resonance and measuring the rms motion across the resonant
    frequency from an \ac{asd} measurement of the OSEM position resonance.
    The OSEM position signal is of the metal ring intermediate mass of the
    output mirror suspension as described in section \ref{sec:doublepend}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Double Pendulum}
\label{sec:doublepend}
The output mirror is suspended by glass fibers inside a ring of steel which is
three inches in diameter. The steel ring is the \ac{sos} controlled mass.
Since the mass of the ring is considerably greater than the mass of the small
mirror, the transfer function for force to position on the small mirror can be
approximated by simply the small mirror mass and resonant frequency.
For the complete solution, the equations of motion that need to be solved for
one dimension (per mass) are,
\begin{align}
{F_1}_{\mathrm{ext}} &= m_2a_2-k_2x_2+k_1\left(x_1-x_2\right) \\
{F_2}_{\mathrm{ext}} &= m_1a_1-k_1\left(x_1-x_2\right) \, .
\end{align}
This system can be modelled by a double pendulum as seen in figure
\ref{fig:doublependulum}.
One can also present the equations of motion diagramatically as in figure
\ref{fig:doublesus}.

\section{Locking Challenges}

\subsection{Optical Lever}
We found the small mirror resonances to be strong enough to prevent locking the
trapping cavity. Our solution to this was to employ an optical lever, where a
laser is reflected off the back of the small mirror and onto a \ac{qpd}.
The photodiode outputs a signal corresponding to the pitch and yaw
of the small mirror.

Using the signal from the \ac{qpd} as the error signal we feed back to the
OSEM actuators using digital filtering.
We employed resonant gain filters in the optical lever loops to damp resonance
modes as necessary to acheive stable locking.

%If you aren't careful with the position of lenses, there
%will be a coupling of the small mirror position to the photodiode signals.
%We took advantage of our carelessness and used the coupled position signal
%to feedback through resonant gain filters in the digital system and applied to
%the OSEM drives of the SOS.

\subsection{Actuation Range and Bandwidth}
Due to seismic noise we needed a fairly wide actuation range at low frequencies.
The maximum range of the laser PZT is plus or minus 160MHz.
This corresponds to about 42nm.
As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:seismic} there is more rms motion than this
at low frequencies.
We needed another actuation path to cover the full range of rms motion at low
frequencies.
For this we use the magnetic force from the OSEM coils.

While attempting to acquire lock, the cavity mirror motion is much larger than
the linewidth of the cavity.
As a result, the \ac{pdh} error signal (fig. \ref{fig:pdh}) sweeps through
rapidly.
Looking at the signal in the time domain (as with an oscilloscope), the
width of the \ac{pdh} error signal is about $50\mathrm{\mu s}$.
One can imagine that we would want a bandwidth of at least
$\approx 1/50\mathrm{\mu s} = 20\mathrm{kHz}$.
In fact a unity gain frequency of about $20\mathrm{kHz}$ turned out to work
well for acquiring lock.

To get this bandwidth a modification to the laser PZT actuation path was
required.
The high voltage amplifier for the laser PZT itself has a bandwidth limit.
In order to extend the range further we used a high-frequency
bypass which passively adds the HV output to the HV input.


\section{Sub-Carrier Servo}
\label{sec:scservo}
As mentioned above, we needed a way of shifting the frequency of the subcarrier
beam in relation to the carrier by $\mathcal{O}\, 100\,\mathrm{kHz}$.
We do this using \ac{aom}s by first shifting in one direction by
$80\,\mathrm{MHz}$, then shifting the opposite direction by
$80\,\mathrm{MHz} + \mathrm{offset}$.
The $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$ frequency source is a crystal oscillator.
The variable frequency source is a \ac{vco} which uses the output of a feedback
servo to modulate the frequency.
The sensor for this feedback is the demodulated beat signal of the output of
the two \ac{aom} frequency sources.
The demodulation is done by mixing the beat signal with the output of a
function generator which is set to the desired offset frequency.
See figure \ref{fig:scsfeedback} for the layout of the electronics.

\caption[Subcarrier Servo Electronics]{This diagram represents the
    electronic path of the subcarrier servo. This circuit locks the frequency
    of the vco to the frequency of the crystal oscillator plus an offset
    which is set by the function generator. This works by mixing the vco
    output and the crystal oscillator output together in a mixer ($\times$ in
    the diagram).
    We take the output of the first mixer and filter it with a low pass
    filter to remove the high frequency output of the mixer so that we
    are left with a sine wave at a frequency which is $f_v-f_x$.
    This low frequency signal is then mixed with the signal from the function
    generator.
    This mixer output is then the filtered with another low pass
    filter.
    The resulting error signal becomes the phase difference between the function
    generator signal and the vco, crystal difference signal, $f_v-f_x$.
    The feedback servo completes this modified phase locked loop.

%        \item $\frac{D\cdot L}{C - B}$
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

\section{Mode Matching}
As will be discussed in section
\ref{sec:expimps}, we went through a revision in our overall layout.
This changed the beam size and waist location in reference to the cavity.
We did not want to open the chamber again for alignment and mode matching.
It was useful to know the power coupling into the cavity with the wrong
mode matching to give us an idea of how much transmitted light we should
expect when the cavity is properly aligned since mode matching is a difficult
process of moving the lenses along the beam path and realigning the beam.

We want to know how much power couples into the cavity from a
perfectly gaussian beam of the wrong size and location. We start with
the equations for the Hermite-Gaussian beam decomposition as discussed in
Siegman \cite{Siegman86}. 

\newcommand{\intinfxy}[1]{\int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} #1 \,dx \,dy}
\newcommand{\intinfrt}[1]{\int^{2 \pi}_{0} \int^{\infty}_{0} #1 r \,dr \,d\theta}


\begin{align}
    c_{nm} &= \intinfxy{
    E(x,y,z) u_n^*(x,z)u_m^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{
    E(x,y,z) u_0^*(x,z)u_0^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{
    u_0(x,z-z_0)u_0(y,z-z_0) u_0^*(x,z)u_0^*(y,z)}
\end{align}

We now assign the labels $b$ for the beam and $c$ for the cavity,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \intinfxy{
    u_{b0}(x,z-z_0)u_{b0}(y,z-z_0) u_{c0}^*(x,z)u_{c0}^*(y,z)} \nonumber
\\  &= \intinfxy{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w^2_0} \right) \left( \frac{q_{b0}}{q_{b}(z)} \right)
    \left( \frac{q^*_{c0}}{q^*_{c}(z)} \right) \exp \left[-ik \left( x^2 + y^2  \right)
    \left( \frac{1}{2q_b(z)} + \frac{1}{2q^*_c(z)} \right) \right]}
\end{align}

Since $q(z) = q_0 + z - z_0$, and $q_0$ is purely imaginary,


\begin{multline}
    c_{00} = \intinfxy{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \\
    \exp \left[
    \frac{-ik \left( x^2 + y^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \right]}
\end{multline}

We start by changing to cylindrical coordinates,

\begin{multline}
    c_{00} = \intinfrt{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \\
    \exp \left[
    \frac{-ik \left( r^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \right]}
\end{multline}

A careful analysis of the exponent will reveal that the real part must be less than $0$.
We can therefore solve the Gaussian integral, setting $s =
\frac{-ik \left( r^2  \right)}{2} \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
$,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \intinfrt{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \exp \left[ s
    \right]} \nonumber
\\  &= \int^{\infty}_{0} \left( \frac{4}{w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \exp \left[ s
    \right] r \,dr
\end{align}

Now we transform the differential and the limits of integration, remembering
that the real part of $s$ is less than $0$, $ds =
-ik \left( \frac{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) r \,dr
$,

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)} \right)
    \int^{0}_{-\infty} e^s \,ds \nonumber
\\  &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+z-z_0)-(-q_{c0}+z)} \right) \nonumber
\\  &= \left( \frac{4i}{k w_{b0} w_{c0}} \right)
    \left( \frac{- q_{b0} q_{c0}}{(q_{b0}+q_{c0}-z_0)} \right)
\end{align}

Now, we rewrite the coefficient in terms of waist sizes and distance between waists, using,
\begin{align*}
    q_0 &= \frac{i \pi w_0^2}{\lambda}
\\  k &= 2 \pi / \lambda
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
    c_{00} &= \frac{2 w_{b0} w_{c0}}{w_{b0}^2 + w_{c0}^2 + i z_0 \lambda / \pi} \nonumber
\\  &= \frac{2 w_{b0} / w_{c0}}{1 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + i z_0 / z_R}
\end{align}

Power coupling into cavity is then (assuming no loss and $r_1 = r_2$),

%\begin{align}
%    P_{mathrm{trans}} &= P_{mathrm{incident}} \frac{}{}
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
    P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4 w_{b0}^2 / w_{c0}^2}{1 +
    2 \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^4 + \left(
    z_0 / z_R \right)^2} \nonumber
\\  P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4}{ 2 + \left( w_{c0} /
    w_{b0} \right)^2 + \left( w_{b0} /w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left(
    z_0 / z_R \right)^2}
\\  P_{\mathrm{trans}}  &= P_{\mathrm{incident}} \frac{4}{ \left( w_{c0} /
    w_{b0} + w_{b0} / w_{c0} \right)^2 + \left( z_0 / z_R \right)^2}
    \label{eq:symetricmatch}
\end{align}

In equation \ref{eq:symetricmatch} we can see readily the symmetry between
$w_{b0}$ and $w_{c0}$, and the symmetry of $z_0$ about $0$, as expected.

\caption[Room Layout]{This depicts the basic layout of how the experiment
    is situated in the lab. The red boxes on table 2 are periscopes necessary
    for getting the laser to the height of the trap cavity, and on the ouput
    side for getting back to the table height for the output optics.}
