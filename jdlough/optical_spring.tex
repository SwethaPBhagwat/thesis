As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, a Fabry-Perot cavity of just the right
length can support a resonant laser field. If this cavity were to be slightly longer or
shorter, the power buildup inside the cavity will fall. The power buildup in the cavity
produces a force due to radiation pressure which pushes against the end mirrors
of the cavity. This force is length dependent, the first order of which gives a spring
term. Clearly, one can see that if the cavity is detuned slightly from resonance a
spring is created. We call this an optical spring.
