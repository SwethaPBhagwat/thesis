In this chapter I will cover the theory necessary for the angular optical trap
which we are striving for and which the Syracuse linear trap is the first major
step on the road.

This chapter is mostly excerpts from the paper which provides the theory and
motivation for the angular optical trap experiment.\cite{Perreca:2014}
Sections \ref{sec:II}, \ref{sec:III}, \ref{sec:IV}, \ref{sec:V}, \ref{app:A},
\ref{app:B}, and \ref{app:C} are copied directly from this paper.
