\section{The Effect of Gravitational Waves on Freely Falling Particles}

In this section we review the effect of gravitational waves on a pair of
freely falling particles in order to introduce some of the concepts that we
need to discuss the detection of gravitational waves from binary inspirals.
For a detailed decription of the propagation and effect of gravitational
waves, we refer to \cite{MTW73,Thorne:1982cv}. Consider first a single
particle moving in curved spacetime. If the particle is freely falling, its
4-velocity, $\vec{u}$, satisfues the geodessic equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:geodessic}
\nabla_{\vec{u}} \vec{u} = \tensor{u}{^\alpha_{;\mu}}u^{\mu} = 0,
\end{equation}
where $;$ denotes the covariant derivative, that is,
\begin{equation}
\tensor{u}{^\alpha_{;\mu}}\tensor{u}{^{\mu}} = \left(\partial_\mu\tensor{u}{^\alpha} +
\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}u^\nu\right) u^\mu,
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}$ is the connection coefficent of the metric
$g_{\alpha\beta}$. Now suppose that we have two particles $A$ and $B$ as shown
in figure \ref{f:particles}. The separation between the particles is
$\vec{\xi}$. The particles are initally at rest with respect to each other, so
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\vec{u}} \vec{u} &= 0, \\
\vec{u} \cdot \vec{\xi} & = 0.
\end{align}
If the spacetime is curved, the second derivative of $\vec{\xi}$ along
$\vec{u}$ is non-zero, however. It is given by the equation of geodessic
deviation
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\vec{u}}\nabla_{\vec{u}} \vec{\xi} = - R(\_,\vec{u},\vec{\xi},\vec{u})
\end{equation}
where $R(\_,\vec{u},\vec{\xi},\vec{u})$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. We now
introduce a \emph{Local Lorentz Frame} (LLF) for particle $A$. A LLF is
cartesian coordinate system defined by three orthogonally pointing giroscopes
carried by particle $A$. The curvature of spacetime means that the coordinate
system is not exactly cartesian, but it can be shown that this deviation is
second order in the spatial distance from the particle\cite{MTW73}. This means
that along the worldline of particle $A$ the metric is
\begin{equation}
g_{\alpha\beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} + \frac{\mathcal{O}\left(|\vec{x}|^2\right)}{R^2}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{\alpha\beta}$ is the flat Minkowski metric, $\vec{x}$ is the
distance from the particle and $R \sim |R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}|$. In the
Local Lorentz frame of particle $A$, the equation of geodessic deviation
becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \xi^{j}}{\partial t^2} = -
\tensor{R}{^j_{\alpha\beta\gamma}}u^\alpha\xi^\beta u^\gamma =
-\tensor{R}{^j_{0k0}} \xi^k
\end{equation}
We assume further that the spacetime is globally flat, so $g_{\alpha\beta} =
\eta_{\alpha\beta}$, with weak gravitational waves propagating in it. We
describe the gravitational waves by $R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$ which
satisfies the wave equation
\begin{equation}
\eta^{\mu\nu}R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta,\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
What is the effect of these gravitational waves on our test particles $A$ and
$B$? In the Local Lorentz frame, $\vec{\xi}$ is just the coordinates of $B$.
Let the two particles lie on the $x$-axis of the LLF and write
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bcoords}
\xi^j = x_{(0)}^j + \delta x^j,
\end{equation}
where $x_{(0)}^j$ is the unperterbed location of particle $B$ and $\delta x^j$
is the change is the position of $B$ caused by the gravitational wave.
Substituting equation (\ref{eq:bcoords}) into the equation of geodessic
deviation, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:particledev}
\frac{\partial^2 \delta x^j}{\partial t^2} = - \tensor{R}{^j_{0k0}} x_{(0)}^k =
-R_{j0k0} x_{(0)}^k,
\end{equation}
where we have used $\eta_{\alpha\beta}$ to lower the spatial index $j$ of the
Riemann tensor. For a weak gravitational wave, all the components of
$R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$ are completely determined by $R_{j0k0}$.
Furthermore, it can be shown that the $3\times3$ symmetric matrix $R_{j0k0}$,
which we would expect to have $6$ independent componets, has only $2$
independent components due to the Einstein equations and the Biancci identity.

Let us define the (transverse traceless) gravitational wave field,
$h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT}$, by
\begin{equation}
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT}}{\partial t^2} \equiv
\tensor{R}{_{j0k0}}.
\label{eq:hjkdef}
\end{equation}
Using this definition in equation (\ref{eq:particledev}), we obtain
\begin{equation}
\delta x^j = \frac{1}{2} h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT} x_{(0)}^k.
\end{equation}
If we orient our coordinates so the gravitational waves propagate in the
$z$-direction, so $h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT}(t-z)$, then the only non-zero components
of $h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT}$ are $h_{xx}^\mathrm{TT}$, $h_{yy}^\mathrm{TT}$,
$h_{xy}^\mathrm{TT}$ and $h_{yx}^\mathrm{TT}$. Since $h_{jk}^\mathrm{TT}$ is
transverse and traceless, these components satisfy
\begin{align}
h_{xx}^\mathrm{TT} &= - h_{yy}^\mathrm{TT}, \\
h_{xy}^\mathrm{TT} &= h_{yx}^\mathrm{TT}
\end{align}
and we define the two independent components of the gravitational wave to be
\begin{align}
h_{+} &= h_{xx}^\mathrm{TT} = - h_{yy}^\mathrm{TT}, \\
h_{\times} &= h_{xy}^\mathrm{TT} = h_{yx}^\mathrm{TT}
\end{align}
which we call the \emph{plus} and \emph{cross} polarizations of the
gravitational wave respectively.

Now consider two more particles $C$ and $D$ lying on the $y$-axis of the LLF
separated by 
\begin{equation}
\zeta^j = y^j_{(0)} + \delta y^j
\end{equation}
as shown in figure \ref{f:rings}. A linearly polarized gravitational wave is
one that only contains the plus or the cross polarization. The influence of
a linearly plus polarized gravitational wave propagating in the $z$-direction
is
\begin{align}
\delta x &= \frac{1}{2} h_{xx}^\mathrm{TT} x_{(0)},\\
\delta y &= -\frac{1}{2} h_{yy}^\mathrm{TT} y_{(0)}
\end{align}
and for the and for a linearly $\times$-polarized gravitational wave
propagating in the $z$-direction is
\begin{align}
\delta x &= \frac{1}{2} h_{xy}^\mathrm{TT} y_{(0)},\\
\delta y &= \frac{1}{2} h_{yx}^\mathrm{TT} x_{(0)}.
\end{align}
Figure \ref{f:rings} shows the effect of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ on a ring
of particles that lie in the $xy$ plane. We can see for the plus polarization
that the that the effect of a gravitational wave is to stretch the particles
in the $x$ direction, while squeezing them in the $y$ direction for the first
half of a cycle and then squeeze in the $x$ direction and stretch in the $y$
direction for latter half of the cycle.  There is therefore a relative change
in length between the two particles $AB$ and $CD$ over the course of a cycle.
For a circularly polarized gravitational wave (which contains both plus and
cross polarizations) propagating in the $z$ direction, $h(t-z) =
h_{+}(t-z) + h_{\times}(t-z)$, the overall effect is
\begin{align}
\delta x &= \frac{1}{2}\left(h_{+}(t-z) x_{(0)} + h_{\times}(t-z) y_{(0)}\right),\\
\delta y &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-h_{+}(t-z) y_{(0)} + h_{\times}(t-z) x_{(0)}\right).
\label{eq:armdisp}
\end{align}
It is this relative change in the lengths of two perpendicular pairs of
particles that we attempt to detect with gravitational wave detectors.We can
see from equation (\ref{eq:armdisp}) that the change in length is proportional
to the original distance between the test masses. For a pair of lest masses
separated by a length $L$, we define the \emph{gravitational wave strain} to
be
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta L}{L} \equiv \frac{1}{2} h_{+} + \frac{1}{2} h_{\times}.
\end{equation}

\section{Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors}
\section{s:ifos}

In order to detect gravitational waves, we want to monitor the motion of two
freely falling test masses. There are several major efforts
underway\cite{ligo,geo,virgo} to measure the strain produced by a
gravitational wave using \emph{laser interferometery}. In this thesis we 
analyze data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory,
LIGO.

The lowest order of gravitational radiation is quadrupolar. There is no
``charge'' or ``current'' dipole gravitational ratiation due to conservation
of linear and angular momentum respectively. The amplitude of gravitational
wave strain is that we wish to detect is approximately\cite{thorne.k:1987}
\begin{equation}
h \sim \frac{2G}{c^5} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \mathcal{I},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{I}$ is the mass quadrupole moment of the source. For typical
astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation that we wish to detect with
LIGO, $h \sim 10^{-22}$. If we separate our test masses by a distance of
$4$~km (a practical distance for Earth bound observatories) the challenge
faced by gravitational wave astronomers is to measure changes of length of
order $\Delta L \sim 20^{-22} \times 10^4\,\mathrm{m} \sim
10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}$ using laser light has a wavelength of $\lambda_l \sim
10^{-6}$~m.  It should be noted that measuring a phase shift of
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi \sim \frac{\Delta L}{\lambda_l} \sim 10^{-12}
\end{equation}
is a factor $10^{12}$ more sensitive than the interferometers used by
Michelson and Morely to disprove the existance of the ether.

The basic concept is of a gravitational wave interferometer is illustrated in
figure \ref{f:ifodesign} (a). Laser light is shone on a \emph{beam splitter}
which reflects half the light in to the \emph{$x$-arm} and transmits half the
light into the \emph{$y$-arm} of the interferometer. The light travels a
distance $L$ in each arm and then is reflected back towards the beam splitter
by the \emph{end test masses}. Consider the light in the $x$-arm. The
space-time interval between the beam splitter and the end test mass is given
by
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}\, dx^\mu\, dx^\nu = 0.
\label{eq:dist}
\end{equation}
The metric of spacetime in the presence of a weak gravitational wave is
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where all the components of $h_{\mu\nu}$ are zero, appart from those defined
in equation (\ref{eq:hjkdef}). In the presence of a plus polarized,
sinusoidal, gravitational wave travelling in the $z$-direction, equation
(\ref{eq:dist}) becomes
\begin{equation}
c^2 dt^2 = \left(1 + h_{+}(t-z)\right) dx^2 + \left(1 - h_{+}(t-z)\right) dx^2,
\end{equation}
We can measure the response of the interferometer to a gravitational wave by
considering the phase shift of light in the arms. The phase that the light
aquires propagating between the beam splitter to the $x$-end test mass and
back is is given by\cite{Saulson:1994}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Phi_x &= \int_0^{\tau_\mathrm{RT}} 2\pi f_l\, dt \\
&= \frac{1}{c} \int_0^L 2\pi f_l \sqrt{1 + h_{+}}\,dx -
\frac{1}{c} \int_L^0 2\pi f_l \sqrt{1 + h_{+}}\,dx \\
&\approx \frac{2\pi f_l L}{c} \left(1 + \frac{h_{+}}{2}\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_\mathrm{RT}$ is the round trip proper time of the light and $f_l$ is
its frequency. We have discareded  higher order terms in $h_+$ as they are
negligable.  We can see that the phase shift aquired in the $x$-arm due to the
gravitational wave is
\begin{equation}
\delta \Phi_x = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_l} h_{+} L.
\end{equation}
A similar calulation shows that the phase shift aquired in the $y$-arm is
\begin{equation}
\delta \Phi_y = - \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_l} h_{+} L
\end{equation}
and so the difference in phase shift between the arms is
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda_l} h_{+} L.
\end{equation}
A typical astrophysical source of gravitational radiation of interest to LIGO,
has a frequency $f_\mathrm{GW} \sim 100$~Hz. Therefore the wavelength of the
gravitational wave is $\lambda_\mathrm{GW} \sim 3000$~km. Notice that if
$\tau_\mathrm{RT} = 1 / f_\mathrm{GW}$ there will be no phase shift of the
light. The light spends exactly one gravitational wave period in the arm and
so the phase shift aquired by positive values of $h_+(t-z)$ is cancelled out
by the phase shift due to negative values of $h_+(t-z)$. The interferometer
achives maximum sensitvity when the light spends half a gravitational wave
period in the arms, that is
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{GW}}{2} \sim 1000\,\mathrm{km}
\end{equation}
which is hopelessly impractical for a Earth bound detector. In order to solve
this problem, we bounce the light in the arms for approximately one half of a
gravitational wave period. In LIGO, we do this by placing two additional
mirrors in the arms of the interferometer, known as the inner $x$ and $y$ test
masses, as shown in figure \ref{f:ifodesign}. This \emph{Fabry-Perot cavity}
in the arms stores the light for $B \sim 200$ bounces, increasing the phase
shift by a factor of $B$
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi = 4\pi \frac{L}{\lambda_l} h_{+} \sim 
10 \cdot \frac{4 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{m}}{10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m}} \cdot 200 \cdot
10^{-21} \sim 10^{-9}.
\end{equation}
This gains us 3 orders of magnitude above of initial estimate of $10^{-12}$.
Increasing $B$ does not gain any sensitivity, however, as we will lose phase
shift as the sign of the gravitational wave changes.

What magnitude of phase delay can we measure at the photodetector? We measure
the phase shift by averaging over some period, $\tau$. Let $N$ be the number
of photons from the laser arriving at the photodiode in the time $\tau$. The
measured number of photons in the averaging interval is a Poisson process,
with probability distribution function for $N$ given by
\begin{equation}
p(N) = \frac{ \bar{N} ^{N} \exp \left(-\bar{N}\right) } {N!},
\end{equation}
where $\bar{N}$ is the mean number of photons per interval $\tau$. A very
large number of photons, $N_\gamma \gg 1$, will arrive at the photodetector in
the averaging time, however, so this Poisson distribution can be approximated
by a Gaussian distribution. The uncertainty in the number of photons arriving in the
averaging time is therefore
\begin{equation}
\Delta N = \sqrt{N}.
\end{equation}
The accuracy that we can measure the phase shift for a given amount of input
laser power is constrained by the uncertainty principle,
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \, \Delta E \ge \hbar.
\label{eq:uncertainty}
\end{equation}
The energy the light arriving at the photodiode in time $\tau$ is
\begin{equation}
E = \hbar \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda_l} N
\end{equation}
which, due to the counting of photons, has uncertainty 
\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \hbar \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda_l} \sqrt{N}.
\label{eq:uncertdeltae}
\end{equation}
Using this and $\Delta\Phi = 2\pi c \Delta t / \lambda_l$ and the uncertainty
principle, equation (\ref{eq:uncertainty}), we obtain
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \, \Delta E = \frac{\Delta \Phi \lambda_l}{2\pi c} \hbar \frac{2\pi
c}{\lambda_l} N \ge \hbar
\end{equation}
and so the accuracy which which we can measure the phase is no better than
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}.
\end{equation}
This equation tells us how many photons we need in an averaging period to
measure a given phase shift. The optimal averaging time for a gravitational
wave with freqency $f_\mathrm{GW}$ is half a period, that is
\begin{equation}
\tau \approx \frac{1}{2 f_\mathrm{GW}}.
\end{equation}
The intensity of laser light required to measure a phase shift of $10^{-9}$
for a gravitational wave of $f_\mathrm{GW} \sim 100$~Hz is then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
I &= N \frac{2 \pi \hbar c \cdot 2f_\mathrm{GW}}{\lambda_l} \\
&\sim \left(\frac{1}{10^{-9}}\right)^2 
\frac{10^2 \times 10^{-34} \times 10^{8} 10^2 } { 10^{-6} } \sim 10^2\,
\mathrm{W}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Lasers used in the first generation of interferometers have a typical output
power of $\sim 5$~W. The final enhacement we make to the Michelson
intereferometer is a \emph{power recycling mirror} place between the beam
splitter and the laser, as shown in figure \ref{f:ifodesign}. This reflects
some of the laser light back into the interferometer and increases the power
incident on the photodiode so that the phase shift due to a gravitational wave
of order $h \sim 10^{-21}$ can be measured.

\section{Gravitational Waves from Binary Inspiral}
\label{s:inspiralgw}

\subsection{The post$^2$-Newtonian Waveform}

\subsection{The Stationary Phase Approximation}
\label{ss:stationaryphase}

The inspiral waveforms that we need in the matched filter are $\tilde{h}_c(f)$
and $\tilde{h}_s(f)$, rather than the waveforms $h_c(t)$ and $h_t(t)$ computed
in chapter \ref{ch:inspiral}. There are two ways of obtaining $\tilde{h_c}(f)$.
The first is to compute $h_c(t)$ then Fourier transform the signal. This is
compulationally expensive, however, as it requires an additional FFT for each
template that we wish to filter. The second method is to use the stationary phase
approximation\cite{Mathews:1992} to express the chirp directly in the frequency
domain\cite{WillWiseman:1996,Cutler:1994}. Given a function
\begin{equation}
B(t) = A(t) \cos \phi(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\ln A}{dt} \ll \frac{d\phi}{dt}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\ln A}{dt^2} \ll \left(\frac{d\phi}{dt}\right)^2
\end{equation}
then the stationary phase approximation to the Fourier transform of $B(t)$ is
given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{B}(f) = \frac{1}{2} A(t) \left(\frac{df}{dt}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\exp\left[ -i \left(2\pi f t' - \phi(f) - \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\right]
\end{equation}
where $t'$ is the time at which
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} = 2\pi f
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\phi(f) = \phi\left[t(f)\right].
\end{equation}

For the restricted post$^2$-Newtonian chirps discussed in chapter
\ref{ch:inspiral}, the orbital frequency at any instant is given by
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{M^{\frac{1}{2}}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}.
\end{equation}
The inspiral rate for circular orbits is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{dr}{dt} = - \frac{r}{E} \frac{dE}{dt} = 
- \frac{64}{5} \frac{\mu M^2}{r^3}.
\end{equation}
Thus
\begin{align}
r^3 \, dr &= - \frac{64}{5} \mu M^2 \, dt \\
\frac{r^4}{4} &= \frac{64}{5} \mu M^2 (t - t_c)
\end{align}
and so
\begin{equation}
r(t) = \left(\frac{256}{5} \mu M^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}
       \left(t_c - t\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}.
\end{equation}
Since the emitted radiation is quadrupolar
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{\Omega}{\pi}.
\end{equation}
The gravitational wave strain is
\begin{equation}
h(t) = \frac{Q}{D} \left(\frac{384}{5}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \pi^\frac{2}{3} \mu M
r^{-1}(t) \cos \left( \int 2\pi f(t) \, dt \right).
\end{equation}
Now
\begin{align}
\frac{df}{dt} 
     &= \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{\Omega}{\pi}\right) 
      = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{M^\frac{1}{2}}{\pi} r^{-\frac{3}{2}}\right) \\
     &= \frac{M^\frac{1}{2}}{\pi} \frac{dr}{dt} \left(-\frac{3}{2} r^{-frac{5}{2}}\right) \\
     &= \frac{M^\frac{1}{2}}{\pi} \left(-\frac{64}{5} \frac{\mu M^2}{r^3}\right)
        \left(-\frac{3}{2} r^{-frac{5}{2}}\right) \\
     &= \frac{96}{5} \frac{M^\frac{5}{2} \mu}{\pi} r^{-\frac{11}{2}}. 
     \label{eq:sp:dfdt}
\end{align}
Now
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{M^\frac{1}{2}}{\pi} r^{-\frac{3}{2}}.
\end{equation}
Solving this for $r$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{M^\frac{1}{3}}{\pi^\frac{2}{3} f^\frac{2}{3}}
\end{equation}
which we can substitute into equation (\ref{eq:sp:dfdt}) and obtain
\begin{align}
\frac{df}{dt} &= \frac{96}{5} \pi^\frac{8}{3} \mu M^\frac{2}{3} f^\frac{11}{3} \\
&= \frac{96}{5} \pi^\frac{8}{3} \mathcal{M}^\frac{5}{3} f^\frac{11}{3}
\end{align}
where we have defined the \emph{chirp mass} by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \mu^\frac{3}{5} M^\frac{2}{5}.
\end{equation}
Now the phase is given to post$^2$-Newtonian order by\cite{Blanchet:1996pi}
\begin{equation}
\phi(t) = \int^t 2\pi f(t') \, dt'
\end{equation}
we won't worry about this yet.

Therefore using the stationary phase approximation, we obtain
\begin{align}
\tilde{h}(f) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q}{D} \left(\frac{384}{5}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \pi^{2}{3} \mu M
                r^{-1}(t) \left(\frac{df}{dt}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-i \Psi\right] \\
             &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q}{D} \left(\frac{384}{5}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \pi^{2}{3} \mu M
                \frac{\pi^\frac{2}{3} f^\frac{2}{3}}{M^\frac{1}{3}}
                \left(\frac{df}{dt}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-i \Psi\right] \\
             &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q}{D} \left(\frac{384}{5}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \pi^{4}{3} \mu
                M^\frac{2}{3} r^\frac{2}{3}
                \left(\frac{df}{dt}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-i \Psi\right].
\end{align}
Now
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{df}{dt}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} =
\left(\frac{5}{96}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \pi^{-\frac{4}{3}} 
\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} M^{-\frac{1}{3}} f^{-\frac{11}{6}}
\end{equation}
and so 
\begin{align}
\tilde{h}(f) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q}{D} \left(\frac{384}{5} \frac{5}{96}\right)^\frac{1}{2}
                \mu^\frac{1}{2} M^\frac{1}{3} f^{-\frac{7}{6}} \exp\left[-i \psi\right] \\
             &= \frac{Q}{D} \mathcal{M}^\frac{5}{6} f^{-\frac{7}{6}} \exp\left[-i \psi\right].
             \label{eq:sp:template}
\end{align}
Equation (\ref{eq:sp:template}) is the stationary phase binary inspiral
template that we will use in the matched filter.

The Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)\cite{barish}
has completed three ``science runs'' during which all three interferometers
were collecting data simultaneously under stable operation. Analysis of the
data for gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries has been
completed for the first two runs\cite{bns1,bns2,macho} and is in progress for
the third run. Two of the target populations in these searches are binary
neutron stars\cite{300yrs} and binary black hole
MACHOs\cite{sammacho,nakamura}. For these low mass systems, which have
component masses below $3 M_\odot$, the waveforms of the gravitational
radiation emitted are well known\cite{bdiww,biww}.  Matched filtering is a
common and effective technique for extracting known signals from
noise\cite{wz}. We have implemented a matched filter to extract inspiral
signals from interferometer noise in the package \emph{findchirp} which can be
found in the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL)\cite{lal}.
