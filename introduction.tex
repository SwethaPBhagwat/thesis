The Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)\cite{barish}
has completed three ``science runs'' during which all three interferometers
were collecting data simultaneously under stable operation. Analysis of the
data for gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries has been
completed for the first two runs\cite{bns1,bns2,macho} and is in progress for
the third run. Two of the target populations in these searches are binary
neutron stars\cite{300yrs} and binary black hole
MACHOs\cite{sammacho,nakamura}. For these low mass systems, which have
component masses below $3 M_\odot$, the waveforms of the gravitational
radiation emitted are well known\cite{bdiww,biww}.  Matched filtering is a
common and effective technique for extracting known signals from
noise\cite{wz}. We have implemented a matched filter to extract inspiral
signals from interferometer noise in the package \emph{findchirp} which can be
found in the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL)\cite{lal}.
