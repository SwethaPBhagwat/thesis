%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Acknowledgements

Over the past five years, I have worked, interacted and made friends with many 
physicists, specially through my membership in the LIGO-Virgo and NINJA
collaboratons and interactions with the SXS collaboration.
Unfortunately, space makes it impossible to thank them all
individually and I hope anyone I do not mention here will forgive me.

\noindent I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown. His vast
knowledge of and passion for gravitational-wave astronomy never ceased to 
inspire me. I am specially indebted to him for his encouragement and for
allowing me freedom to pursue scientific ideas.

\noindent I would also like to thank the other members of my defense committee --- Marina
Artuso, John Laiho, Carl Rosenzweig, Peter Saulson, and Jason Wiles ---
for taking time out of their busy schedules to read and critique my work.

\noindent I am grateful to Syracuse University gravitational-wave faculty,
Peter Saulson and Stefan Ballmer, for their many excellent questions 
regarding my work, and valuable insights into the inner workings of the 
LIGO detectors. I would specially like to thank my academic adviser Peter
Saulson, for his patience and candid advice.


\noindent To Ian Harry and Eliu Huerta, I want to extend my gratitude for helping
me with much of what I learned during my research at Syracuse. And also for 
all the beer we shared.


\noindent I would also like to thank Alex Nitz, Ryan Fisher and Satya Mohapatra,
for all of the conversations and questions every Friday morning. I want to thank
Peter Couvares for all his help with Condor and friendly conversations about 
computer science and things. 


\noindent I have learnt a great deal working with Numerical Relativists on the NINJA-2
and template bank projects. I would specially like to thank Harald Pfeiffer, 
Mark Scheel, Bela Szilagyi and Christian Ott for listening to and critiquing
my work.


\noindent On the data analysis side of the LVC, I would like to thank Thomas Dent, 
Collin Capano, Larne Pekowsky, Satya Mohapatra, and Kipp Cannon, 
for productive conversations at different points of time over the past five years.


\noindent This would also be the right place to express my gratitute towards
my previous mentors, Badri Krishnan and Anu Gupta. Their mentorship and advice
helped shape my research interests.


\noindent It has been a pleasure to share an office with Matt West, Jim Lough, 
and T J Massinger, and I want to thank them for their innumerable help and 
for bearing with me.


\noindent None of this would have been possible without the love and support of
my parents and family, and I am deeply indebted to them. This would also 
be the right place to thank my friends for all the good times and incisive
conversations, specially Antonio, Shiladitya, Ishaan, Pavan, Jayanth, Medhavi,
Mandeep, SriKrishna, Sai, Harmish, PP, Sapan, Amandeep, Matt W, Matt H, 
Auritro, Sandeep, Arun, Hardik, David, Aniruddha, Mike, Chitra, 
Nitin, and Hooda, in no particular order.


\noindent Finally my sincerest gratitute goes towards all the physicists and mathematicians
before my time, on whose shoulders we are standing. 
Without their curiosity and perseverence, we would still be at the center of our
solar system.
Specially, I would like to thank Late Richard Feynman, whose verbose thinking
and flair for simplification and visualization instilled in me a passion for the
subject.
