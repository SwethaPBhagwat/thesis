In this chapter we briefly review the treatment of compact object
binaries in General Relativity (henceforth GR), with a view at providing a 
description of the gravitational waves emitted during their coalescence. In 
Sec.~\ref{sec:general_relativity}, we revise the basic concepts of 
differential geometry and their application in general relativity. 
Then we go on to describe the generation of gravitational radiation in 
linearized GR in Sec.~\ref{sec:gravitational_radiation}. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:effects_of_waves}, we describe the effect of incident
gravitational waves on freely-falling particles. This discussion will 
be carried over in the next chapter where we discuss the concept
and design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:PNWaveforms} we discuss the generation of gravitational waves
by a compact object binary system in quasi-circular orbits, as it evolves 
through the inspiral phase to its coalescence. Searches performed over 
detector data use theoretically modeled waveforms for compact binaries as 
filters. We briefly summarize two of the primary waveform models applicable
to LIGO-Virgo sources in Sec.~\ref{sec:PNWaveforms}.


\section{General Relativity}
\label{sec:general_relativity}

We begin with summarizing basic concepts of differential geometry used 
and work up to writing down Einstein's equations. Readers are referred
to the books by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler~\cite{mtw}, 
Schutz~\cite{BSchutzBook}, and Wald~\cite{WaldBook} for broader treatments
of these topics.

\subsection{Manifolds: Vectors, Forms and Tensors}

An manifold is a set that has the local differential 
structure of $\Reals^n$, but not necessarily its global properties. 
An n-dimensional, infinitely continuously differentiably (i.e. $C^\infty$
real manifold $M$ is a set along with sub-sets $S_\alpha$, which together
obey the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Every element $p\in M$, is a member of at least one $S_\alpha$.
 This ensures that $\{S_\alpha\}$ covers M.
 \item There exists a one-to-one, onto, map $\Psi_\alpha :S_\alpha \rightarrow U_\alpha$
 for each subset $S_\alpha$ to an open subset of $\Reals^n$, $U_\alpha$. This ensures
 that locally, every {\it patch} of the manifold $M$ has the properties of 
 a Euclidian space.
 \item If any two subsets $S_\alpha$ and $S_\beta$ overlap, there exists a $C_\infty$
 map $\zeta\defeq\Psi_\beta \circ \Psi_\alpha^{-1}$ which maps elements of the open 
 set $U_\alpha \subset \Reals^n$ to $U_\beta \subset \Reals^n$ (with notation as
 above). 
\end{enumerate}
{\it Curves} are maps from $\Reals^n$ to the manifold $M$, 
and {\it scalar functions} are reverse maps from $M\rightarrow \Reals^n$. 
A composite of a function $f$ with a curve $\gamma$ gives a map from
$\Reals^n\rightarrow\Reals^n$. 
%
Doing calculus on manifolds invokes the concept of 
{\it vectors} in a local sense, or {\it tangent} vectors.
In general, there is no concept of vector operations over vectors at 
different poins in the manifold, as there is in vector spaces. 
A tangent vector $u$ at a point $p\in M$ is defined as a
linear differentiation operator which maps functions defined at $p$,
to $\Reals$. By definition, $u$ obeys the Leibnitz rule:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 u(f(p) g(p)) = u(f(p)) g(p) + f(p) u(g(p)) 
\end{equation}
where both $f$ and $g$ are functions in the sense mentioned above.
The tangent vectors exist in a {\it distinct} n-dimensional vector space $T_pM$
at each point $p$ in the manifold. 
They can be identified with local directional derivatives
and be decomposed in the local coordinate basis $\pd/\pd x^\mu$,
where $\{x^\mu\}$ forms the coordinate system on $\Reals^n$.
We will denote this special basis as $\pd_\mu$ or $\vec{e}_\mu$ henceforth.
A tangent vector field can be defined over the manifold, associating each point 
$p\in M$ to a vector defined locally at $p$.
 
\iffalse
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{d \lambda} fi \big|_p = 
  \frac{d}{d\lambda} (f \circ \gamma) \big|_p
\end{equation*}


Expanding this in terms of a chart whose domain includes $p$ and then
applying the chain rule
 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{d \lambda} fi \big|_p &= 
 \frac{d}{d\lambda} ( (f \circ \phi^{-1}) \circ (\phi \circ
\lambda) ) \\
&= \frac{d(\phi^{-1} \circ \gamma)^\mu}{d\lambda} 
\frac{\partial (f \circ \phi^{-1}) }{\partial x^\mu} \big|_p \\
&= \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} \partial_\mu f \big|_p
\end{align*}

where $x^\mu$ are the coordinates on $\mathcal{R}^n$.  Finally, since
the function $f$ is arbitrary we can define

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tangent_vector}
\frac{d}{d\lambda} = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} \partial_\mu
\end{equation}
\fi

A \emph{one-form} (or a {\it dual} vector) is a linear map from vectors to
$\Reals$, e.g. for a point $p\in M$, $\omega :T_pM\rightarrow\Reals$. 
The set of one-forms at the point $p$ form a vector space. A natural basis
for the same, $\{\tilde{\omega}^\mu\}$, can be obtained by solving
%
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\omega}^\nu \vec{e}_\mu = \delta_\mu^\nu
\end{equation*}
%
The components of an arbitrary form $\omega$ in this basis may be
found by the application of the form to basis vectors, i.e.
$\omega_\mu\defeq \omega(\vec{e}_\mu)$.
%
\iffalse
\begin{align*}
\omega(\vec{e}_\nu)
&= \tilde{\omega}^\mu \omega_\mu (\vec{e}_\nu) \\
&= \omega_\mu \tilde{\omega}^\mu (\vec{e}_\nu) \\
&= \omega_\mu \delta^\nu_\mu \\
&= \omega_\nu\\
\end{align*}
\fi
%
From vectors and one-forms, we can build up an arbitrary ${m \choose n}$
{\it tensor} as a linear map from outer products of $m$ vectors and $n$ 
one-forms to $\mathcal{R}$.  The components of a tensor $T$ in a choice of
coordinates can be found by applying it to combinations of the basis
vectors and basis one-forms.  Finally, a ${m \choose n}$ tensor field is
a map that associates to each point $p$ in $\mathcal{M}$ an element in
the space of  ${m \choose n}$ tensors at $p$.

\subsection{The Metric Tensor}

Over the 4-dimensional manifold of spacetime, we can define a metric $g$
which is a ${2\choose 0}$ tensor with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
 \item It defines the notion of a distance between infinitesimally separated 
 points $ds$, 
 \begin{equation}
  ds^2\defeq g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu.
 \end{equation}
 \item It is symmetric in its indices, i.e. $g_{\mu\nu}=g_{\nu\mu}$.
 \item The determinant $|g_{\mu\nu}|$ is non-zero, making $g$ invertible: 
 $\exists\, g^{\rho\nu}: g_{\mu\rho}g^{\rho\nu} = \delta^\nu_\mu$.
%  \item 
\end{itemize}
% 
% 
% A particularly important tensor in general relativity is the
% \emph{metric}, a ${2 \choose 0}$ tensor that is symmetric ($g_{\mu\nu}
% = g_{\nu\mu})$ and non-degenerate (the determinant of $g$ taken as a
% matrix $|g_{\mu\nu}| \neq 0$.  The latter feature makes it possible to
% define the inverse metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ as
% %
% \begin{equation*} g^{\mu_\rho} g_{\rho_\nu} = \delta^\mu_\nu
% \end{equation*}
% %
Given a vector $x^\mu$ the object $g_{\mu\nu} x^\mu$ maps another
vector to a real number, and is therefore a one-form.  The metric
therefore maps between the space of vectors and the space of 
one-forms.  
% Most importantly, the metric defines a notion of
% distance on the manifold.  Infinitesimally
% %
% \begin{equation} ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu \end{equation}
% %
In special relativity, in Cartesian coordinates, the metric has
components $(-1,1,1,1)$ along the diagonal, and all other components are
zero. This {\it flat} spacetime metric will be denoted $\eta_{\mu\nu}$
henceforth.

\subsection{Covariant Derivative and Parallel Transport}
\label{ssec:covariant_derivative}\label{ssec:parallel}

A {\it (covariant) derivative operator} $\cd$ on a manifold $M$ is a map
which takes each differentiable ${m\choose n}$ tensor field to a smooth
tensor field of type ${m\choose n+1}$, and satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Linearity: $\cd_\alpha (kA^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} + lB^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n}) = k\cd_\alpha A^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} + l\cd_\alpha B^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n}$,
 \item Leibnitz rule: $\cd_\alpha (A^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} B^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n}) = \cd_\alpha (A^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n}) B^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} + A^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} \cd_\alpha (B^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n})$,
 \item Commutativity with contraction of indices:  $\cd_\alpha (A^{a_1\dots c\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots c\dots b_n}) = \cd_\alpha A^{a_1\dots c\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots c\dots b_n}$, and, 
 \item Agrees with the notion of tangent vectors as directional derivatives on scalar fields.%: $v(f) = v^\alpha\cd_\alpha f$. 
\end{itemize}
In GR, it is additionally required that the commutator of the derivative 
operator $[\cd_\alpha, \cd_\beta]f\defeq [\cd_\alpha\cd_\beta - \cd_\beta\cd_\alpha]f$ 
be zero when acting on a scalar field $f:M\rightarrow\Reals$, 
a condition that has so far been borne by experiments.
This commutator is called the {\it torsion} tensor, and $\cd$ is called
{\it torsion} free if the above condition is satisfied.

The application of $\cd$ on a vector field gives
%
\begin{equation}
 \cd_\mu x^{\nu} \vec{e}_\nu = \cd_\mu (x^\nu) \vec{e}_\nu + x^\nu \cd_\mu \vec{e}_\nu,
\end{equation}
%
where the second term on the right may not vanish in coordinate systems 
other than Cartesian in flat spacetime, or in curved spacetime. However, 
we must be able to write the new vector in the original basis. The components
are called {\it connection coefficients}, and are denoted as $\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu}$:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:covariant_derivative}
 \cd_\mu x^{\nu} \vec{e}_\nu &= \cd_\mu (x^\nu) \vec{e}_\nu + x^\nu \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\mu} \vec{e}_\rho \\
 &= (\pd_\mu x^\nu + x^\rho \Gamma^\nu_{\rho\mu}) \vec{e}_\nu
\end{align}
In similar notation, the action of $\cd$ on a one-form $\omega$ can be obtained, 
noting that $\cd_\mu (v^\nu \omega_\nu) = \pd_\mu (v^\nu \omega_\nu)$, such that
%
\begin{equation}
 \cd_\mu \omega_\nu = \pd_\mu\omega_\nu + \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu}\omega_\rho.
\end{equation}
Extending this to general ${m\choose n}$ tensors, we get that 
\begin{equation}
 \cd_\mu T^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} = \pd_\mu T^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} + \Sum_{i} \Gamma^{a_i}_{\mu d} T^{a_1\dots a_{i-1} d\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_n} - \Sum_{i} \Gamma^{d}_{\mu b_i} T^{a_1\dots a_m}_{b_1\dots b_{i-1} d\dots b_n}.
\end{equation}

The covariant derivative gives differential structure to the manifold $M$, 
allowing for moving a vector {\it without changing it}, or in other words
the ``parallel transport'' of a vector. Given the operator $\cd_\alpha$, a vector 
$v$ is said to be parallel transported along a curve $C$, with a tangent 
vector $t^\alpha$, if 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parallel_transport}
 t^\alpha \cd_\alpha v^\beta = 0
\end{equation}
all along $C$. An intuitive visualization of parallel transport is of 
moving a vector that is perpendicular to the Equator of the Earth (at longitude
$L_0$) parallel to itself along the Equator, followed by transporting it along
a different longitude $L_1$ till it reaches the North pole, and further
parallel transporting it back along $L_0$ to its original location.
The returned vector would not be parallel to the original vector, even 
though it was never rotated with respect to itself. This therefore 
indicates that the surface on which it was moved is itself curved.
Eq.~\ref{eq:parallel_transport} shows that the parallel transport 
of $v^\alpha$ depends solely on itself along the curve $C$. Also, 
it can be shown that given an initial value of $v^\alpha$,
Eq.~\ref{eq:parallel_transport} always has a unique solution~\cite{WaldBook}. 
A remarkable result follows, which is that a vector at a point $p$ on the curve
$C$ uniquely defines a ``parallel transported vector'' everywhere else on $C$.
This idea will also help us define curvature in a later section of this 
chapter.

Of particular interest is the case where a vector is
parallel-transported along itself
%
\begin{equation*}
v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\nu = v^\mu (\partial_\mu v^\nu + \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\rho} v^\rho) = 0.
\end{equation*}
%
Now consider a curve $x(\lambda)$ such that $v$ is the tangent to this
curve, $v^\mu = d x^\mu/d\lambda$, then
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:geodesic}
\frac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}
  \frac{\partial }{\partial x^\mu}
  \frac{d x^\nu}{d\lambda}  
+ \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\rho} 
\frac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}
\frac{d x^\rho}{d\lambda} &= 0 \nonumber \\
\frac{d^2 x^\nu}{d\lambda^2}
+ \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\rho} 
\frac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}
\frac{d x^\rho}{d\lambda} &= 0 
\end{align}
%
Eq.~\ref{eq:geodesic} is called the the \emph{geodesic equation}. 
The solution to this equation defines the path along which test masses 
that are acting solely under the influence of gravity move, in other 
words it defines the trajectory of freely falling particles. 

\subsection{The Christoffel Symbols}

Given just the manifold structure, many distinct derivatives can be 
defined on it. However, with the availability of a metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, 
we can require another condition that scalars do not change 
under parallel transport along an arbitrary vector $t^\alpha$. 
For arbitrary vector fields $u^\alpha$ and $v^\beta$, we take the 
scalar $g_{\mu\nu}u^\mu v^\nu$ and require that
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:parallel_transport_scalar}
t^\mu \nabla_\mu (g_{\alpha\beta} u^\alpha v^\beta) = 0 =
x^\mu (\nabla_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}) u^\alpha v^\beta
+ g^{\alpha\beta} (x^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\alpha) v^\beta
+ g^{\alpha\beta} u^\alpha (x^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\beta).
\end{align}
%
As this must hold for arbitrary $u$ and $v$, it must also hold when
both are constant. This sets the last two terms on the right hand side
of Eq.~\ref{eq:parallel_transport_scalar} to zero. We have left
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:metric_compatibility}
\nabla_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} = 0,
\end{equation}
which is also known as the {\it metric compatibility} condition. 

Equation~\ref{eq:metric_compatibility} and the requirement that $\cd$ be
torsion-free together fix the connection coefficients $\Gamma$, which can be
written in terms of the metric as:
%
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu}
= \frac{1}{2} g^{\rho\sigma}\left[
\partial_\nu g_{\mu\sigma}
+ \partial_\mu g_{\nu\sigma}
- \partial_\sigma g_{\mu\nu}
\right]
\end{equation}
% 
Combining this with Eq.~\ref{eq:geodesic} in the previous section,
we see that the motion of particles are completely specified once we know
the metric of the spacetime and their initial positions and velocities.

\subsection{Field Equations of Gravity}

When a vector is parallel transported from a point $p$ to $q$ along $C$ in the
manifold $M$, the final vector at $q$ will, in general, depend on the choice of
$C$. We can generalize the example given in Sec.~\ref{ssec:covariant_derivative}
and use the path dependence of parallel transport to define an instrinsic notion
of curvature of the underlying manifold. We transport a vector $u^\alpha$ along
an infinitesimal parallelogram with sides defined by $v^\beta$ and $w^\gamma$.
The failure of a vector to return to its original value when parallel 
transported about a closed loop can be used to define the Riemann tensor
$R^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu}$:
% 
% 
% We now generalize the example given in Sec.~\ref{ssec:covariant_derivative},
% and ask how a vector $A^\mu$ changes as it is parallel-transported around
% an infinitesimal parallelogram with sides defined by the vectors
% $B^\mu$ and $C^\nu$.  Recalling that vectors and directional
% derivatives are the same thing, it can be shown that this is
% equivalent to asking how covariant derivatives fail to commute.  The
% result must be linear in $A^\mu$ and so we may write
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:riemann_def}
\left[\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu - \nabla_\nu \nabla_\mu\right] v^\rho
= R^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu} v^\sigma
\end{equation}
%
A number of properties follow from this definition (which are either
follow trivially or may be proven by substituting the definition of the
covariant derivative, Eq.~\ref{eq:covariant_derivative}.  First, we note that
$R^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu}$ is (anti-)symmetric in the first and last pair of 
its indices:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:symmetries}
R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}
= -R_{\sigma\rho\mu\nu}
= -R_{\rho\sigma\nu\mu}
= R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
\end{equation}
%
which also imply
%
\begin{align}
R^\rho_{[\sigma\mu\nu]} = 0,
\end{align}
where $[\dots]$ denotes the anti-symmetrization over the enclosed indices.
Second, we have the Bianchi identities,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bianchi}
\cd_\alpha R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}
+\cd_\mu R_{\rho\sigma\nu\alpha}
+\cd_\nu R_{\rho\sigma\alpha\mu} = 0
\end{equation}

Eq.~\ref{eq:riemann_def} can be straightforwardly generalized to obtain 
the change in an arbitrary tensor upon being parallel-transported around an
infinitesimal loop.  It can be shown that~\cite{WaldBook}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:higher_order_riemann}
\left[\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu - \nabla_\nu \nabla_\mu\right] 
B^{\rho_1 \rho_2 \ldots \rho_n}
= - R^{\rho_1}_{\sigma \mu\nu} B^{\sigma \rho_2 \ldots \rho_n}
- R^{\rho_2}_{\sigma \mu\nu} B^{\rho_1 \sigma \ldots \rho_n}
- \ldots -
- R^{\rho_n}_{\sigma \mu\nu} B^{\rho_1 \rho_2 \ldots \sigma }
\end{equation}
%
which can be proved by expanding
%
\begin{equation*}
\left[\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu - \nabla_\nu \nabla_\mu\right] 
(\vec{e}_\rho \otimes \vec{e}_\sigma)
\end{equation*}
%
and subsequently using the second principle of mathematical induction.  

Due to the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, it can be shown that there is 
exactly one non-trivial contraction, up to a sign, which is between its
first and third or second and fourth indices:
%
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} = R^\sigma_{\mu\sigma\nu}.
\end{equation}
%
$R_{\mu\nu}$ is also known as the {\it Ricci} tensor. Contracting again, we get
%
\begin{equation}
R = R^\mu_\mu
\end{equation}
%
which is the unique non-trivial \emph{Ricci} scalar that can be formed from
the Riemann tensor.

Contracting the Bianchi identity twice gives
%
\begin{equation*}
\cd_\alpha R_{\sigma\mu\nu}^\alpha + \cd_\sigma R_{\mu\nu} - \cd_\mu R_{\sigma\nu} = 0.
\end{equation*}
%
Raising the index $\nu$ and contracting over $\mu$ and $\nu$, we obtain
%
\begin{equation*}
\cd_\alpha R^\alpha_\mu + \cd_\sigma R_\mu^\sigma - \cd_\mu R = 0
\end{equation*}
%
Relabeling the dummy indices and using metric compatibility gives
%
\begin{equation*}
2\cd^\mu \left(R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R \right) = 0,
\end{equation*}
%
which defines the divergenceless tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:einstein_tensor}
G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R
\end{equation}
%
It follows trivially that $G$ is symmetric: $G_{\mu\nu} = G_{\nu\mu}$.

Continuous matter distributions in special relativity are described by a 
symmetric tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ called the {\it stress-energy-momentum} tensor.
For an observer with 4-velocity $u^\mu$, the component $T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu$
is the energy density as measured by the observer. For non-relativistic matter,
the energy density $\simeq T^{00}$ and is the same as the mass density $\rho$;
while $T^{0i}$ is the momentum in the $i-$th direction. Conservation of 
momentum, i.e. $\pd_t \rho = \pd_i p^i$ can therefore be written as
% 
% We now relate this to physics by noting that the matter and energy
% content of a region is described by the stress-energy tensor
% $T_{\mu\nu}$ where each component is ``the flow of $\mu$ momentum in the
% $\nu$ direction.''  For example, the $0,0$ component is energy density
% and the $0,i$ components are the $i^\mathrm{th}$ components of
% momentum.
% 
% Conservation of energy requires that the difference in momentum
% ($p^i$) across each face of a cube be balanced by a change of energy
% ($\rho$), within the cube,
% %
% \begin{equation*}
% \partial_t \rho = \partial_i p^i
% \end{equation*}
%
% In terms of the stress-energy tensor this becomes
%
\begin{equation*}
- \nabla^0 T_{00} + \nabla^i T_{0i} = \nabla^\nu T_{0 \nu} = 0
\end{equation*}
%
However, as the time direction is not uniquely specified, a change of
coordinates will mix space and time components. Therefore, the above
equation must generalize to 
%
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^\nu T_{\mu\nu} = 0,
\end{equation*}
%
which says that the stress-energy-momentum tensor $T$ is divergenceless like
$G$, and like $G$ it is also symmetric. Einstein proposed the ansatz
%
\begin{equation*}
G_{\mu\nu} \propto T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation*}
%
where the proportionality constant is fixed by requiring agreement with 
Newton's law of gravity in the low energy limit, when $T^{00}\gg$ all other
components of $T$, to $8\pi$. Now, we can finally write down the field 
equations of gravity which Einstein proposed in $1915$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:einsteins_equation}
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
%
As $G_{\mu\nu}$ is entirely determined by the spacetime metric, and 
the tensor $T$ is determined by the stresses, energy and momentum 
distribution and flows of matter in the universe, these equations connect 
the curvature of spacetime with properties of matter that resides in it.


\section{Gravitational Radiation}
\label{sec:gravitational_radiation}

Due to the nonlinear nature of the gravitational field equations, 
Eq.~\ref{eq:einsteins_equation}, it is difficult to find its solutions, 
and only a handful of exact solutions are known. However, solving them
in the weak field approximation is often useful, mainly because the 
gravitational fields encountered in many physical systems are indeed weak.
A weak gravitational field is characterized by a metric of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:metric_weak_field}
 g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
with $|h_{\mu\nu}|\ll 1$. In this approximation, we can think of the 
spacetime as flat with $h_{\mu\nu}$ representing a ${2\choose 0}$ tensor
field propagating on it. To linear order in $h_{\mu\nu}$ the Riemann 
tensor can be found to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemann_h_linear}
 R^\alpha_{\beta\gamma\delta} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\pd_\gamma\pd_\beta h^\alpha_\delta + 
 \pd_\delta\pd^\alpha h_{\beta\gamma} -
 \pd_\gamma\pd^\alpha h_{\beta\delta} - 
 \pd_\delta\pd_\beta h^\alpha_\gamma\right).
\end{equation}
Contracting on two of the indices, we can write the Ricci tensor to be:
\begin{equation}
 R_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\pd_\alpha\pd_\beta h + \Box h_{\alpha\beta} - 
 \pd_\beta\pd_\gamma h^\gamma_\alpha - \pd_\gamma\pd_\alpha h^\gamma_\beta \right).
\end{equation}
With some algebric manipulation, and substituting 
$h_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow \hbarr_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu\nu}h$,
the field equations reduce to
\begin{equation}
 \Box \hbarr_{\mu\nu} + \eta_{\mu\nu}\pd_\alpha\pd_\beta \hbarr^{\alpha\beta} - 
 \pd_\nu\pd_\alpha \hbarr^\alpha_\mu - \pd_\mu\pd_\alpha\hbarr^\alpha_\nu = -16\pi T_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
It can be shown that this equation is invariant under the gauge transformations
produced by a vector $\zeta_\alpha$: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:h_gauge_transform1}
 \hbarr^{\mu\nu} \rightarrow \hbarr^{'\mu\nu} = \hbarr^{\mu\nu} - 
 \pd^\mu\zeta^\nu - \pd^\nu\zeta^\mu + \eta^{\mu\nu}\pd_\alpha \zeta^\alpha .
\end{equation}
Imposing the following gauge conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:h_gauge_fixing1}
 \pd_\nu \hbarr^{'\mu\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
the field equations reduce to their familiar form which is manifestly similar
to a wave equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:h_wave_source}
 \Box \hbarr^{\mu\nu} = -16\pi T^{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}

Before discussing the final solutions, we describe an alternate perturbative 
analysis which has the advantage of being completely gauge invariant. The
action of the wave operator $\Box$ on the Riemann tensor is
\begin{align*}
 \Box R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} &= 8\pi\left( \cd_\alpha(\cd_\beta\Tbar_{\gamma\delta} - \cd_\gamma\Tbar_{\beta\delta})  - \cd_\beta(\cd_\alpha\Tbar_{\gamma\delta} - \cd_\gamma\Tbar_{\alpha\delta}) \right) \\ &\hspace{5mm}+
 \mathcal{O}(R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}Tbar_{\mu\nu}) + \mathcal{O}(R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}^2),
\end{align*}
where the higher order terms involving the product of the curvature tensor with 
itself or with the stress-energy tensor are ignored in the linear 
approximation. In the absence of matter or momentum sources, the above equation
simplifies further to the free wave equation. The solutions of that can be 
written down as:
\begin{equation}
 R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} = C_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} e^{\ii k_\mu x^\mu}.
\end{equation}
Using the Bianchi identities, Eq.~\ref{eq:bianchi}, it can be shown that the 
only relevant components of the Riemann tensor are those of the form 
$R_{\alpha 0\beta 0}$. Imposing Einstein's equations further restricts the 
possible non-zero components of $R_{\alpha 0\beta 0}$ to be of the form 
$R_{x0x0}$ or $R_{y0y0}$ or $R_{x0y0}$, and it can be also shown that 
$R_{x0x0} = -R_{y0y0}$ from $R_{00}=0$. This leaves only two independent 
degrees of freedom for the gravitational wave solution in empty space. 

Going back to the description in terms of the metric perturbations 
$\hbar_{\mu\nu}$, we can write the solution to Eq.~\ref{eq:h_wave_source}
in empty space as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:h_wave_solution}
 \hbarr_{\mu\nu}(\vec{x},t) = \int \D^3 k\, A_{\mu\nu}(\vec{k}) e^{\ii (\vec{k}\dotfill \vec{x} - \omega t)}.
\end{equation}
Having imposed the gauge condition of Eq.~\ref{eq:h_gauge_fixing1}, the total 
degrees of freedom become $10 - 4 = 6$. Eq.~\ref{eq:h_wave_source} are invariant
under transformations of the kind similar to Eq.~\ref{eq:h_gauge_transform1}
if $\Box\zeta^\alpha = 0$ and Eq.~\ref{eq:h_gauge_fixing1} are still satisfied.
The four of the remaining spurious degrees of freedom can be removed by fixing
the gauge to the {\it transverse-traceless} gauge, in which
\begin{equation}
 h_{00} = h_{0\mu} = 0;\hspace{10mm} h = h^\mu_\mu = 0;\hspace{10mm} \pd_\mu h^{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
It can be shown that while the gauge conditions in Eq.~\ref{eq:h_gauge_fixing1}
can be imposed in the context of linear perturbation theory {\it irrespective of
the presence of sources}, the transition to TT gauge is possible {\it only} in 
vacuum. 
%
The second gauge fixing reveal the $6 - 4 = 2$ physical degrees of freedom, which
is what was shown for the Riemann tensor in the discussion above 
Eq.~\ref{eq:h_wave_solution}. 
In fact, a one-to-one correspondance between the two can be found by simplifying 
Eq.~\ref{eq:riemann_h_linear}:
%
\begin{equation}
 R_{\mu 0\nu 0} = \frac{1}{2}\pd_0^2 h^{TT}_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
%
Therefore, in the TT gauge, for a wave propagating in the z-direction, we have:
\begin{equation}
 h_{xx}^{TT} = -h_{yy}^{TT} \equiv h_+(t-z);\hspace{10mm} h_{xy}^{TT} = -h_{yx}^{TT} \equiv h_\times(t-z),
\end{equation}
and consequently
\begin{equation}
 R_{x0x0} = -\frac{1}{2}\pd_0^2 h_{xx}^{TT};\hspace{10mm} R_{x0y0} = -\frac{1}{2}\pd_0^2 h_{xy}^{TT}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, there are two independent degrees of freedom in a propagating 
gravitational wave that can be described in terms of the two functions 
usually denoted by $h_+$ and $h_\times$. In the TT gauge they are simply
related to the $xx$, $yy$ and $xy$ components of the metric perturbation.
Defining two polarization tensors $e_+$ and $e_\times$ that can be obtained
from $h_{\mu\nu}$ by alternately setting $h_+=1,\,h_\times=0$ and 
$h_+=0,\,h_\times=1$, we write down that 
\begin{equation}
 h_{\mu\nu}^{TT} = h_+ e_+ + h_\times e_\times.
\end{equation}
The incident gravitational waves on Earth, from an astrophysical source 
is likely to be a superposition of these two polarizations. 



\section{Effect of Gravitational Waves}
\label{sec:effects_of_waves}

We now derive the effect of gravitational waves on matter.  Consider
two particles moving along world-lines $A^\mu$ and $B^\mu$.  Choose
coordinates so that $A$ remains fixed at the origin, $A^\mu =
(1,0,0,0)$.  We may further specialize our coordinates such that at
the origin $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$.  It can be shown that we may
also require that the first derivatives of the metric vanish at this
point.  We may not, however, make the second derivatives vanish in
general.  This corresponds to the fact that the Riemann tensor is
defined in terms of second derivatives.  We call the coordinate system
thus constructed a \emph{Local Lorentz Frame}.

We now define the separation between the two particles as 
%
\begin{equation*}
\xi^\mu = B^\mu - A^\mu
\end{equation*}
%
We fix $\xi$ to be perpendicular to $A$, so that $\xi^0 = 0$.  If space
is curved it can readily be seen that $\xi$ will not remain constant.
For example, if the particles are initially at rest some distance from
the surface of the Earth they will both move towards the center of the
Earth and $\xi$ will decrease.  It can be shown that $\xi$ obeys the
equation of \emph{geodesic deviation},
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:geodesic_deviation}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \xi^\rho = -R^\rho_{\mu\nu\sigma} A^\mu \xi^\nu A^\sigma
=-R^\rho_{0 \nu 0} \xi^\nu 
\end{equation}
%
Using the condition that $\xi$ has no time component reduces this to 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \xi^i = -R^\rho_{\mu\nu\sigma} A^\mu \xi^\nu A^\sigma
=-R^i_{0 j 0} \xi^j
\end{equation}
%
That is, the change in separation between two
infinitesimally-separated test masses at rest with respect to each
other in an arbitrary gravitational field is entirely specified by
$R^i_{0 j 0}$.  From the symmetries of the Reimann tensor this is
symmetric in $i$ and $j$, and hence appears to have 6 independent
components.  However, it can be shown that these can entirely be
specified by two values, which without loss of generality we take to
be $R^x_{0 x 0}$.  $R^x_{0 y 0}$.  We now recall that in empty space
$R_{\mu\nu} = 0$, which implies that $R^y_{0 y 0} = - R^x_{0 x 0}$.
We summarize this by saying that R is \emph{traceless}.  

We now specialize to the case of gravitational waves, so that the
Riemann tensor satisfies Eqn.~\ref{eq:riemann_wave} and we choose
coordinates such that the wave is traveling in the $z$ direction.
Using the fact that the speed of light is 1 in dimensionless units the
solution can then be written
%
\begin{equation*}
R_{i 0 j 0} = A_{ij}(t - z)
\end{equation*}
%
where we have lowered the first index to simplify notation.

Now, using the fact that $\partial_x R_{i0j0} = \partial_y R_{i0j0}
= 0$ and integrating the Bianchi identity we can show that
$R_{x 0 y 0} = R_{y 0 x 0}$ and that all other components vanish.
It can also be shown that in addition to being traceless $R$ is
\emph{transverse}, $k^j R_{i0j0} = 0$.  We denote these two facts by
adding the superscript $TT$, and define the gravitational-wave field as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_field}
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 h_{ij}^{TT}}{\partial t^2}
\equiv R^{TT}_{i0j0}
\end{equation}

We now decompose the separation vector $\xi$ into the initial
separation and a time-dependant perturbation, $\xi = \xi_0 + \delta
\xi$.  In terms of this Eqn.~\ref{eq:geodesic_deviation} becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:geodesic_deviation_delta}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \delta \xi^i = -R^{0 i 0 j} \xi_0^j
\end{equation}
%
where we drop the initial portion from the left-hand side because it
is constant, and we drop the perturbation from the right hand side
because it is much smaller than the initial portion.  Comparing
eqn.~\ref{eq:wave_field} and eqn.~\ref{eq:geodesic_deviation_delta}
we obtain the equation for the effect of a gravitational wave on
free-falling test masses:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_effect}
\delta \xi^i = \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{ij} \xi^j
\end{equation}
%
We note in passing that this is the same result obtained in other
treatments by expanding the metric in terms of the flat-space metric
plus a perturbation, $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$,
substituting into the Einstein equation and expanding to first order
in $h$, and then choosing a gauge in which $h$ is transverse and
traceless.

Now, define
%
\begin{align*}
h_+ &\equiv h_{xx} = - h_{yy} \\
h_\times &\equiv h_{xy} = h_{yx}
\end{align*}
%
which we refer to as the \emph{plus} ($+$) and \emph{cross} ($\times$)
polarizations, respectively.  Consider the case where $h_\times = 0$.
If particle $B$ is initially on the $x$ axis then 
%
\begin{align*}
\delta \xi^x &= \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{xx} \xi^x \\
\delta \xi^y &= \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{xy} \xi^y \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
%
The particle remains on the $x$ axis.  For an oscillatory wave the
distance between the two particles likewise oscillates.  We can
describe this as an induced \emph{strain}, $\Delta L/L$ where $L$ is
the initial separation.  If $B$ is initially on the $y$ axis
%
\begin{align*}
\delta \xi^x &= \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{xx} \xi^x \\
&= 0 \\
\delta \xi^y &= \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{yy} \xi^y \\
&= - \frac{1}{2} h^{TT}_{xx} \xi^y
\end{align*}
%
The particle remains on the $y$ axis and oscillates out of phase with
a corresponding particle on the $x$ axis.  The net effect is that,
after a quarter cycle, a set of masses initially in a circle are moved
into an ellipse flattened along one axis and stretched along the other
such that the area remains constant.  After another quarter cycle they
return to a circle, in the next quarter cycle they are in an ellipse
with the axes flipped, and so on. It is similarly straightforward to
show that for a wave cross-polarized wave the eigendirections are on
the lines $x=\pm y$.  The effects are the same as for the $+$
polarization, rotated 45 degrees.

Now consider a thought experiment, originally due to Feynman, where we
place a bead on a stick in the path of a gravitational wave.  The wave
will cause the bead to slide back and forth, heating the stick trough
friction and imparting energy to the system.  This implies that
gravitational waves carry energy.  This argument can be made
precise~\cite{RevModPhys.29.509}.

\section{Modeling Gravitational Waves}

Having demonstrated the predicted existence of gravitational waves and
their effects on matter we now turn to the question of their
generation.  From Eqn.~\ref{eq:wave_field} we can see that, since
the components of the Riemann tensor obey the wave equation, the
components of $h^{TT}$ do as well.  We now consider the solution of
the wave equation when the source, the stress-energy tensor, is not
zero.  By analogy with electromagnetism we can immediately write down
the solution in terms of retarded fields
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:h_from_t}
h^{TT}_{ij} = 4 \left[ \int \frac{T_{ij}(x', t-r)}{r}\, d^3 x'
\right]^{TT}
\end{equation}
%
where we integrate over the source distribution $x'$.  When the energy
and momentum densities are small, so that the curvature of spacetime
is likewise small, the coordinates may be taken to have their
conventional flat-space meaning.  We may also replace the covariant
derivative by regular partial differentiation.

Starting from the conservation of energy and momentum written in terms
of the stress-energy tensor
%
\begin{align*}
{T^{00}}_{,0} &= - {T^{0j}}_{,j} \\
{T^{i0}}_{,0} &= - {T^{ij}}_{,j} \\
\end{align*}
%
Differentiating with respect to time and going through some algebra
yields expressions for the first and second moments of the stress
energy tensor, ${T^{lm}}_{,ml} x^j x^k$ and ${T^{jm}}_{,m} x^k$.  These,
plus Stoke's theorem, can be used to simplify
Eqn.~\ref{eq:h_from_t} to give
%
\begin{equation*}
h^{TT}_{ij} = \frac{2}{r} \left[
\int {T^{00}}_{,00}\, x^i x^j d^3 x' \right]^{TT}
\end{equation*}
%
We recognize $T^{00}$ as the mass/energy density, and therefore this
can be written as the \emph{quadrapole formula}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadrupole_formula}
h^{TT}_{jk} = \frac{2}{r} \ddot{\mathcal{I}}(t-r)
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{I}$ is the quadrupole moment of the source
%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{I}_{ij} = \int \rho(\mathbf{x})x_i x_j\,d^3 x
\end{equation*}

Any system of mass with a time-dependant quadrupole moment will give
rise to gravitational radiation.  However, restoring physical units to
Eqn.~\ref{eq:quadrupole_formula} scales the right-hand side by
$G/c^4$.  We therefore need very large masses and/or rapid changes in
order to generate waves we have any chance of detecting.  There are
many such sources of astrophysical and cosmological interest:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item supernovae
\item rotating neutron stars with axial asymmetry
\item processes in the early universe, which would have produced
\emph{relic} gravitational waves in principle still detectable today
\item topological defects
\item compact bodies, such as neutron stars and black holes, in 
orbit around each other.
\end{itemize}
%
We will focus on the last of these for the remainder of the thesis.

It is straightforward to start from the mass distribution of two point
masses in orbit around their center:
%
\begin{align*}
\rho(\mathbf{x}) &= m_1\delta(x - r_1\cos(\Omega t)) \delta(y-r_1
\sin(\Omega t)) \delta(z) \\
&\quad + m_2\delta(x + r_2\cos(\Omega t)) \delta(y + r_2 \sin(\Omega t))
\delta(z)
\end{align*}
%
and calculate $h^{TT}$. By choosing coordinates centered on a
terrestrial gravitational-wave detector and a basis we can write
the gravitational-wave strains as~\cite{DBrownThesis}
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:h_plus_cross}
h_+(t)   &= - \frac{2G}{c^4 r} \mu (\pi G M f)^{\frac{2}{3}}
(1+\cos^2(\iota)) \cos(2\pi f t - 2\phi_0) \\ \nonumber
h_\times(t)  &= - \frac{4G}{c^4 r} \mu (\pi G M f)^{\frac{2}{3}}
\cos(\iota) \sin(2\pi f t - 2\phi_0) \nonumber
\end{align}
%
where $M = m_1+m2$, $\mu = m_1 m_2 / M$, $f$ is the
\emph{gravitational-wave frequency} which is twice the orbital
frequency $f = 2\Omega/2\pi$, $\phi_0$ is the orbital phase at a
specified time, and $\iota$ is the \emph{inclination} of the binary
with respect to the detector, the angle between the normal to the
plane of the binary and the line joining the detector to the binary.

We noted above that gravitational waves carry energy.  This energy
must be balanced by a loss of energy by the system.  This energy can
not be localized to any one point of the wave, since any point can be
placed in a Local Lorentz Frame where there is no wave.  However, by
averaging over a cycle it can be shown~\cite{carrollTextbook} that
%
\begin{equation}
t_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{32 \pi} \left\langle h^{TT}_{\rho \sigma,\mu}
(h^{TT})^{\rho\sigma}_{,\nu} \right\rangle
\end{equation}
%
where $t_{\mu\nu}$ is the \emph{stress-energy pseudo-tensor}.  The
stress energy tensor itself is zero in a region of spacetime
containing only gravitational radiation.  However, $t$ may be used to
describe the energy content of such radiation, and we find the flux of
energy in the radial direction out of a sphere enclosing a gravitating
system is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy_loss}
\frac{dE}{dt} = T_{0r} = \frac{1}{8 \pi r^2} \left\langle \ddot{\mathcal{I}}^{ij}
\ddot{\mathcal{I}}_{ij} \right\rangle
\end{equation}

When the separation between the masses, $a$ is large and the masses are
moving slowly the gravitational energy of the system is approximately
given by the Newtonian expression
%
\begin{equation*}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{G \mu M}{a}
\end{equation*}
%
Therefore, orbiting bodies will emit gravitational radiation and
\emph{inspiral} until they inevitably collide.

\section{Post-{N}ewtonian Approximations}
\label{sec:PNWaveforms}

Substituting Eqn.~\ref{eq:h_plus_cross} into
Eqn.~\ref{eq:energy_loss} shows that the power emitted goes as
$a^{-5}$.  Most of the power from an inspiral, and therefore our best
chance of detecting such systems, occurs when the masses have become
close and are about to merge.  The approximations we made in the
previous section are no longer valid in this regime.  In order to
obtain analytic models of gravitational waves from inspirals to a
precision that will be useful in searches we must therefore consider
higher-order corrections beyond Newtonian mechanics of the binary.
This leads to \emph{post-Newtonian} (pN) waveforms.

The key to doing this is the requirement that the energy flux carried
away by gravitational radiation must be balanced by loss of energy of the
system
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equivilent_exchange}
\frac{dE}{dt} = - \mathcal{F}
\end{equation}
%
It can be shown~\cite{mtw} that the energy of a body of mass $\mu$ moving
on a geodesic in the Schwarzschild metric with mass $M$ is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
E = \mu \frac{1-2M}{\sqrt{1-3M/r}} 
\end{equation}
%
We now introduce the parameter $v = (\pi M f)$, which is the velocity
in Newtonian mechanics.  We now consider the \emph{adiabatic
approximation}, where we treat the system as moving through a series
of circular orbits.  On a circular geodesic $v= \sqrt{M/r}$ and the
energy becomes
%
\begin{equation}
E = \mu \frac{1-2v^2}{\sqrt{1-3v^2}} 
\end{equation}

We have written down the flux to first pN order above in
Eqn.~\ref{eq:energy_loss}, in terms of the parameter $v$ it is
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} = \frac{32}{5} \left( \frac{\mu}{M} \right) v^{10}
\end{equation}
%
Going to higher order requires techniques that are beyond the scope of
this thesis.

Both the energy and flux may now be expanded in powers of $v$.  We
could then obtain $t$ as a function of $v$ by rewriting
Eqn.~\ref{eq:equivilent_exchange} and integrating.  However, we
will instead obtain an expression relating time and the orbital phase
$\phi = \int 2\pi f\, dt$ by writing
%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F} = - \frac{dE}{dv} \frac{dv}{d\phi} \frac{d\phi}{dt}
\end{equation*}
%
which leads to the expression
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expansion_for_phi}
\phi = \phi_0 + \frac{2}{M} \int_v^{v_\mathrm{ref}} \frac{v^3
dE/dv}{\mathcal{F}}\, dv
\end{equation}
%
where $v_\mathrm{ref}$ is the velocity at a given reference velocity,
or equivalently reference frequency.  If $\mathcal{F}$ is given as a
Taylor series in $v$ then $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ may be expanded to the
same order.  $dE/dv$ may be similarly expanded, and the integrand
becomes the product of polynomials with rational coefficients.

Motivated by Eqn.~\ref{eq:h_plus_cross} we model the waveform as a
time-dependant amplitude and evolving phase:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:general_waveform}
h(t) = A(t) \cos(\phi(t)) = \frac{1}{2} A(t) \left(e^{i\phi(t)} +
e^{-i\phi(t)} \right)
\end{equation}
%
For reasons that will become clear in the next chapter it is often more
convenient to work in the frequency domain, so we take the Fourier
transform of Eqn.~\ref{eq:general_waveform}
%
\begin{align}
\tilde{h}(f) &= \frac{1}{2} \int A(t) \exp(2\pi i f t + i
\phi(t))\, dt \\ \nonumber
&\qquad + \frac{1}{2} \int A(t) \exp(2\pi i f t - i
\phi(t))\, dt \\ \nonumber
\end{align}

We next apply the \emph{stationary-phase approximation}.  Oscillatory
integrands cancel except where the phase is stationary, at extrema of
the exponent.  We therefore expand the exponent around the time $t_0$
of the extremum and discard the linear term
%
\begin{equation}
2 \pi i f t + i \phi(t) \approx (2 \pi i f t_0 + i \phi(t_0))
+ \frac{1}{2} i \ddot{\phi}(t_0) (t-t_0)^2
\end{equation}

Substituting back, the first term leads to a constant factor and the
second leads to a Gaussian integral.  Going through the calculation
yields the approximate waveform
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spa_waveform}
\tilde{f}(f) = \frac{2 G \msun}{c^2 r}
\left(\frac{5 \mu}{96 \msun} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\left( \frac{M}{\pi^2 \msun} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\left( \frac{G \msun}{c^3}\right)^{-\frac{1}{6}}
f^{-\frac{7}{6}} \Theta(f - f_c) e^{i \Psi(f;M,mu)}
\end{equation}
%
where $\msun$ is the mass of the sun and is introduced to so that $M$
is measured in solar masses, a useful unit in astrophysical work.
$\Psi$ is the result of the expansion~\ref{eq:expansion_for_phi}
written as a function of $f$.  The coefficients coming from the
expansion of the flux will depend on the mass $M$ and ration $\mu$ or
equivalently mass and \emph{symmetric mass ratio} $\eta = \mu/M$.  In
general waveforms may also depend on other parameters such as the
spins of the objects.  We introduce the step function to terminate the
waveform at a \emph{cutoff frequency} $f_c$.  This reflects the fact
that we do not trust this approximation all the way through the
evolution of the binary to merger.  The appropriate value for the
cutoff frequency is one of the questions we will address in
chapter~\ref{ch:comparison}.

There are many different ways to perform post-Newtonian expansions, in
both the time and frequency domains.  These lead to different
waveforms which have been assigned standard names, a summary of the
variations we will encounter throughout this thesis is given in
Appendix A.  We note here in particular that the stationary-phase
approach discussed above leads to waveforms denoted \emph{TaylorF2}.
The degree to which these different waveforms agree has been studied in
Ref.~\cite{BuonannoIyerOchsnerYiSathya2009}. 


\subsection{Effective One-Body}
\label{ssec:EOB}

A relatively recent development in post-Newtonian theory is the
\emph{effective one-body} (EOB)
formulation~\cite{BuonannoDamour:1999}.  The basic idea is familiar
from non-relativistic classical mechanics, where it is common to write
the Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in terms of a particle with
reduced mass $\mu = m_1m_2 /(m_1 + m_2)$ moving in a central potential
due to a fixed body of mass $M = m_1 + m_2$.  

In general relativity we have noted that the energy, or equivalently
the Hamiltonian, takes the form of Eqn.~\ref{eq:hamiltonian} for
circular geodesics in a spherically symmetric spacetime.  The EOB
approach proceeds by seeking a map from the general two-body problem
to an equivalent spherically symmetric metric
%
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -A(R) c^2 dT^2 + \frac{D(R)}{A(R)} dR^2 + R^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2 \theta
d\varphi^2)
\end{equation}
%
where the functions are written as expansions in $(GM/c^2R)$.  The
Hamiltonian of geodesic motion in this metric captures the
conservative portion of the motion (as can be seen by the fact that
the metric has no $T$ dependence).  Radiation-reaction terms can then
be added to this Hamiltonian to capture energy carried away by
gravitational waves.  This process results in coupled differential
equations which can be evolved numerically and from which the
gravitational waveforms can be obtained.

A key feature of the EOB approach is the use of \emph{Pad\'{e}
resummation}.  Given a function $f(x)$ with Taylor series $\sum a_i
x^i$ one ``resums'' the series into the ratio of polynomials $\sum b_i
x^i/\sum c^i x_i$ by expanding this ratio in a Taylor series and
matching the coefficients to the original series, then solving for the
$b_i$ and $c_i$.  The resulting function can converge to $f$ faster
than the Taylor series.

The expansion of the unknown functions in the metric to useful order
leads to unknown coefficients that can not be determined from the
problem alone.  These must be found by fitting the results to a
waveform obtained through other means.  This is one application of
waveforms from Numerical Relativity, discussed in the next section.
The resulting waveforms are called
\emph{EOBNR}~\cite{Buonanno:2009qa}.
% 
% 
% \section{Numerical Relativity}
% \label{sec:NRWaveforms}
% 
% Analytic methods themselves can not provide complete gravitational
% waveforms valid through the merger of the two objects and the
% evolution of the resulting single object to a steady state.  Even
% where there is hope of being able to capture the full physics, as in
% EOB or phenomenological models that have been developed, the
% results must be tuned against complete waveforms which must be
% calculated using other means.
% 
% There is a long history of solving partial differential equations
% numerically on computers, and while Einstein's equations are in a
% particularly difficult class of such equations, we can hope to obtain
% complete solutions numerically.  This proved to be a remarkably
% difficult problem, and progress through the 1990s was slow due to both
% conceptual difficulties and limited computational power.  However,
% following Pretorius' successful simulation of two merging black
% holes~\cite{Pretorius:2005gq} and breakthroughs by researchers at
% Goddard~\cite{Campanelli:2005dd} and the University of Texas at
% Brownville and Florida Atlantic University~\cite{Campanelli:2005dd} in
% 2005 the field has expanded rapidly.  Readers are referred to the
% textbook by Alcubierre~\cite{alcubierreTextbook} and review articles
% by Husa~\cite{Husa:2007zz} and Hindler~\cite{Hinder:2010vn} for more
% details than can be provided here.
% 
% The basis of most approaches in numeric relativity (hence ``NR'') is the
% ``3+1'' decomposition of Einstein's equation.  There is a similar
% situation in electromagnetism.  Maxwell's equations may be expressed
% in a geometric, four-dimensional form
% %
% \begin{align*}
% F^{\mu\nu}_{,\nu} &= j^\mu \\
% \mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu}_{,\nu} &= 0
% \end{align*}
% %
% where $F$ is the electromagnetic field tensor and $\mathcal{F}$ is its dual.
% However, this is not the most usual form in which to do calculations.
% Instead we choose a time direction and rewrite in terms of separate
% spatial and temporal differential operators,
% %
% \begin{align}
% \label{eq:constraints1}
% \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= 4\pi \rho \\
% \label{eq:constraints2}
% \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
% \label{eq:evolution1}
% \partial_t \mathbf{E}   &= \nabla \times \mathbf{B} - 4\pi j^\mu \\
% \label{eq:evolution2}
% \partial_t \mathbf{B}   &= - \nabla \times \mathbf{E} \\ \nonumber
% \end{align}
% %
% Note that equations~\ref{eq:constraints1} and \ref{eq:constraints2}
% are \emph{constraint equations} that impose conditions on valid
% solutions at any given time, and in particular for initial conditions.
% Equations~\ref{eq:evolution1} and \ref{eq:evolution2} are
% \emph{evolution equations} which determine how to evolve the system.
% 
% Wile much work in numerical relativity includes matter, for the
% purpose of this thesis  we restrict our attention to \emph{vacuum
% spacetimes}, that is, situations where $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$ everywhere.
% It is a remarkable fact that, although black holes are characterized
% by a mass parameter, a spacetime containing only black holes and
% gravitational waves is a vacuum.  We need therefore only be concerned
% with general relativity, without considering the equations governing
% any other fields.
% 
% In general relativity the split into space+time  is accomplished by
% writing the metric as 
% %
% \begin{equation*}
% ds^2 = -(\alpha^{2}-\gamma_{ij}\beta^{i}\beta^{j})dt^{2}
%    + 2 \gamma_{ij}\beta^{j}dt\,dx^{i}
%    + \gamma_{ij}dx^{i}\,dx^{j}, 
% \end{equation*}
% %
% where $\gamma_{ij}$ is a metric on the slices of constant time $t$,
% and the scalar function $\alpha$ and  vector field $\beta^i$ are
% commonly used to encode the freedom of coordinate choice.  This
% results in a division of the Einstein equation.~\ref{eq:einsteins_equation}
% into constraint and evolution equations.  However, this split is not
% uniquely determined and care must be taken to ensure that the
% resulting systems are well-behaved.  In particular, there may be
% issues ensuring that the constraints remain satisfied as the system
% evolves.  While this is guaranteed mathematically in the continuum
% limit it may not be true once the system is discretized.
% 
% Once a scheme for performing the 3+1 split has been decided upon it is
% then necessary to find initial data that captures the situation of
% interest and satisfies the constraint equations.  There are many ways
% to do this.  Most approaches assume the spatial metric on the initial
% slice is \emph{conformally flat}, meaning each point has a
% neighborhood which can be mapped to flat space.  We have seen that at
% any one point the metric can be made to be the flat-space metric with
% vanishing first derivatives, but this does not extend into a
% neighborhood in general.  In particular, NR systems do not include the
% history of gravitational waves that would have been produced by the
% system prior to the start of the simulation.  This deviation from the
% true physics manifests as a burst of spurious ``junk radiation'' at
% the start of the system.
% 
% The creation of initial conditions is complicated for black holes by
% the presence of singularities, which can not be captured in a
% simulation.  Most codes adopt the ``moving puncture'' approach.  The
% idea is to consider black holes as ``wormholes'' with an internal
% asymptotically flat region, and then compactify this region.  A
% conceptually simpler approach is to excise the points near the
% singularity from the computational grid, but care must be taken to
% ensure that the excised region is causally disconnected from the
% computational domain in order to avoid unphysical results.
% 
% There are a number of techniques for performing the evolution.  A
% common approach is to evaluate the metric on a grid and replace
% derivatives with differences.  An alternative is to use \emph{spectral
% methods}, which involve expanding the solution in terms of a set of
% basis functions, and then evolving the coefficients.  In this scheme
% differentiation can be performed analytically.  In either scheme there
% is a tradeoff between accuracy and performance.  A finer grid will
% give more accurate results, but at the cost of higher computational
% cost.  As simulations typically take weeks to months even on large
% computer clusters, improving the performance is desirable.  Most codes
% therefore use some form of \emph{adaptive mesh refinement}, employing
% a finer grid only in regions close to the holes where the metric is
% changing rapidly.
% 
% In order to extract gravitational-wave information most approaches use
% the \emph{Newman-Penrose scalar}, which in vacuum may be written
% %
% \begin{equation*}
% \Psi_4 = R_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} n^\alpha \bar{m}^\beta n^\gamma
% \bar{m}^\delta
% \end{equation*}
% %
% where $m$ and $n$ are vectors constructed from the basis vectors,
% which in spherical coordinates are
% %
% \begin{align*}
% n &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\hat{t} - \hat{r}\right) \\
% m &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\hat{\theta} +i  \hat{\phi}\right)
% \end{align*}
% %
% and $\bar{m}$ is the complex conjugate of $m$. The gravitational-wave
% strain is related to $\Psi_4$ by two time derivatives,
% %
% \begin{equation*}
% \Psi_4 = \ddot{h}_+ - i \ddot{h}_\times
% \end{equation*}
% 
% 
% \subsection{Hybrid Waveforms}
% \label{sec:HybridWaveforms}
% 
% As noted, NR simulations require a great deal of time and resources;
% typically a single simulation starting 10 orbits before the merger
% will require a few weeks of runtime on approximately 50-100
% processors~\cite{Scheel:2008rj}.  These requirements scale with the
% length of the waveform extracted.  Long waveforms are therefore
% prohibitively expensive; the longest currently available span about 30
% cycles before merger.  Systems of astrophysical interest less massive
% than about $36 \msun$ will spend many more cycles in the frequency
% range to which Initial LIGO is most sensitive.  We therefore desire
% much longer waveforms.  Post-Newtonian waveforms can not be extended
% upwards into the late inspiral and merger, and NR waveforms can not be
% extended downwards to the early inspiral.  However, we can consider
% ``stitching'' a pN waveform to an NR in order to create a \emph{hybrid
% waveforms}.
% 
% This turns out to be possible, although as we will see in
% chapter~\ref{ch:ninja2} there are subtleties in doing so that have not
% yet been fully resolved.  One approach described 
% in Ref.~\cite{Boyle2008a} is to work with $\Psi_4$ and match the numerical
% waveform to the pN waveform by adjusting the time and phase offsets of
% the pN waveform to minimize the quantity
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:MatchingChiSquared}
%   \Xi(\Delta t, \Delta \phi) = \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\, \left[
%     \phi_{\mathrm{NR}}(t) - \phi_{\mathrm{pN}}(t - \Delta t) - \Delta \phi
%   \right]^{2}\, d t \ .
% \end{equation}
% %
% This technique has been shown~\cite{Boyle2007} to give good results
% when the pN waveform is taken to be the time-domain \textit{TaylorT4}
% waveform (see Appendix A) with terms up to 3.5-pN in phase and 3.0-pN
% in amplitude.

% 
% \section{NR}
% \label{sec:NR}
% 
% Optimal searches for gravitational waves use matched filtering, which
% requires accurate knowledge of the waveform~\cite{thorne.k:1987}.
% Previous searches in LIGO data have used post-Newtonian and
% phenomenological templates to search for the coalescence of black-hole
% binaries~\cite{Abbott:2005pf,Abbott:2007xi,Abbott:2008}. Over the last
% several years numerical relativity has made remarkable breakthroughs
% in simulating the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of black-hole
% binaries. The computational cost of these simulations is high,
% however, making it impractical to use them directly as template
% waveforms for use in a matched-filter search. It has been shown that
% there is good agreement between the waveforms generated by numerical
% relativity with analytic post-Newtonian waveforms to within just a few
% orbits of merger~\cite{Buonanno-Cook-Pretorius:2007, Baker2006d,
%   Pan2007, Buonanno2007, Hannam2007, Boyle2007, Gopakumar:2007vh,
%   Hannam2007c, Boyle2008a, Mroue2008, Hinder2008b}.
% 
% 
% \subsection{Hybrid Waveform}
% \label{sec:HybridWaveform} %
% Numerical simulations cannot simulate a very large portion of the
% inspiral of a black-hole binary system.  Indeed, the longest such
% simulation currently in the literature is the one used here---which
% extends over just 32 gravitational-wave cycles before merger.
% Fortunately, this is the only stage in which simulations are needed.
% It has been shown previously~\cite{Boyle2007} that the
% \textit{TaylorT4} waveform with 3.5-pN phase and 3.0-pN amplitude
% matches the early part of this simulation to very high accuracy.  We
% generate a \textit{TaylorT4} waveform of over 8000 gravitational-wave
% cycles ($t \sim 1.2\times 10^{6}M$, starting at $M f=0.004$), and
% transition between the two to create a hybrid.  This long waveform is
% sufficient to ensure that---even for the lowest-mass systems we will
% consider---the waveform begins well before it enters the frequency
% band of interest to LIGO.
% 
% We begin with $\Psi_4$ data, which will later be integrated to obtain
% $h$.  Following Ref.~\cite{Boyle2008a}, we match the numerical
% waveform to the pN waveform by adjusting the time and phase offsets of
% the pN waveform to minimize the quantity
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:MatchingChiSquared}
%   \Xi(\Delta t, \Delta \phi) = \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\, \left[
%     \phi_{\NR}(t) - \phi_{\pN}(t - \Delta t) - \Delta \phi
%   \right]^{2}\, d t \ .
% \end{equation}
% Here, we choose $t_{1}=900\,M$ and $t_{2}=1730\,M$, which is closer to
% the beginning of the waveform than in the previous paper.  This
% particular interval is chosen to begin and end at troughs of the small
% oscillations due to the residual eccentricity $e\sim 5\times 10^{-5}$
% in our numerical waveform.  Taking a range from trough to trough or
% peak to peak---rather than node to node, for example---of the
% eccentricity effects minimizes their influence on the matching.  The
% eccentricity oscillations can be seen more easily after low-pass
% filtering the waveform, though we find filtering to be unnecessary for
% this paper.  The junk radiation apparent in the waveform as shown here
% has no effect on the resulting match---as we have verified by
% filtering, and redoing the match.  Because the final waveform will
% incorporate no numerical data before $t_{1}$ and very little
% immediately thereafter (as explained below), the junk radiation will
% have no effect on any of our results---as we have also explicitly
% verified.  In particular, by integrating $\Psi_{4}$ to obtain $h$, we
% will effectively smooth the junk radiation.

%     matching region.  Also note that the phase difference is fairly

%   \label{fig:MatchingPhaseComparison}
% \end{figure}%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In Fig.~\ref{fig:MatchingPhaseComparison} we compare the phase of the
% numerical and pN waveforms.  The quantities plotted are
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \delta \phi & \equiv & \phi_{\pN} - \phi_{\NR}\ , \\
%   \frac{\delta A}{A} & \equiv & \frac{A_{\pN} - A_{\NR}}{A_{\NR}}\ , 
% \end{eqnarray}
% shown over the interval on which both data sets exist.  The vertical
% bars denote the matching region.  Note that the phase difference is
% well within the accuracy of the simulation (about 0.01 radians,
% represented by the horizontal band) over a range extending later than
% the matching region.  Also, the difference between the two is fairly
% flat, which implies that the match is not very sensitive to the region
% chosen for matching.  Because of this, we expect that the phase
% coherence between the early pN data and the late NR data will be
% physically accurate to high precision.
% 
% The hybrid waveform is then constructed by blending the two matched
% waveforms together according to
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \label{eq:HybridWaveform}
%   A_{\hyb}(t) &= & \tau(t)\, A_{\NR} + \left[ 1 - \tau(t) \right]\,
%   A_{\pN}(t)\ , \\
%   \phi_{\hyb}(t) &= & \tau(t)\, \phi_{\NR} + \left[ 1 - \tau(t)
%   \right]\, \phi_{\pN}(t)\ .
% \end{eqnarray}
% The blending function $\tau$ is defined by
% 
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:BlendingFunction}
%   \tau(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
%       0 & \mathrm{if}\quad t<t_{1}  \\
%       \frac{t-t_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}} & \mathrm{if}\quad t_{1} \leq t < t_{2} \\
%       1 & \mathrm{if}\quad t_{2} \leq t
%     \end{array} \right.
% \end{equation}
% 
% The values of $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ are the same as those used for the
% matching.  The amplitude discrepancy between the pN waveform and the
% NR waveform over this interval is within numerical
% uncertainty---roughly $0.4\%$.  As with the matching technique
% (Eq.~(\ref{eq:MatchingChiSquared})), this method is similar to that of
% Ref.~\cite{Ajith-Babak-Chen-etal:2007b}, but distinct, in that we
% blend the phase and amplitude, rather than the real and imaginary
% parts.  This leads to a smoothly blended waveform, shown in
% Fig~\ref{fig:WaveformSnapshot}.

%     hybridization region.  The $0$ on the time axis corresponds to the
%     beginning of data from the numerical simulation.}
%   \label{fig:WaveformSnapshot}
% \end{figure}%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% Up to this point, the waveform has been $\Psi_{4}$ data.  With the
% long waveform in hand, we numerically integrate twice to obtain $h$,
% and set the four integration constants so that the final waveform has
% zero average and first moment~\cite{Pfeiffer-Brown-etal:2007}.
% Because of the very long duration of the waveforms, this gives a
% reasonable result, which is only incorrect at very low
% frequencies---lower than any frequency of interest to us.  We have
% also checked that our results do not change when we effectively
% integrate in the frequency domain by taking
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:PsiFourIntegration}
%   \tilde{h} = -\frac{\tilde{\Psi}_{4}}{4\,\pi\, f^{2}}\ ,
