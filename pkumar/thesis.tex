\Abstract{
\color{blue}{Gravitational waves are a consequence of the general theory of
relativity.  Direct detection of such waves will provide a wealth of
information about physics, astronomy, and cosmology.  A worldwide
effort is currently underway to make the first  direct detection of
gravitational waves.  The global network of detectors includes the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which
recently completed its sixth science run.

A particularly promising source of gravitational waves is a binary
system consisting of two neutron stars and/or black holes.  As the
objects orbit each other they emit gravitational radiation, lose
energy, and spiral inwards.  This produces a characteristic ``chirp''
signal for which we can search in the LIGO data.  Currently this is
done using matched-filter techniques, which correlate the detector
data against analytic models of the emitted gravitational waves.
Several choices must be made in constructing a search for signals from
such binary coalescences. 

Any discrepancy between the signals and the models used will reduce
the effectiveness of the matched filter.  However, the analytic models
are based on approximations which are not valid through the entire
evolution of the binary.  In recent years numerical relativity has had
impressive success in simulating the final phases of the coalescence
of binary black holes.  While numerical relativity is too
computationally expensive to use directly in the search, this progress
has made it possible to perform realistic tests of the LIGO searches.
The results of such tests can be used to improve the efficiency of
searches.

Conversely, noise in the LIGO and Virgo detectors can reduce the
efficiency.  This must be addressed by characterizing the quality of
the data from the detectors, and removing from the analysis times that
will be detrimental to the search.

In this thesis we utilize recent results from numerical relativity to
study both the degree to which analytic models match realistic
waveforms and the ability of LIGO searches to make detections.  We
also apply the matched-filter search to the problem of removing times
of excess noise from the search.}

\prefacesection{Preface}
The work presented in this thesis stems from my participation in the
LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the NINJA-2 Collaboration.  This
work does not reflect the scientific opinion of the LSC and it was not
reviewed by the collaboration.

\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}

I have been fortunate to work with many wonderful people through my
membership in the LIGO and NINJA collaborations.  Sadly space makes it
impossible to thank them all individually, and I hope the vast
majority I must omit will forgive me.

I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown..


\prefacesection{Conventions}

We adopt the Einstein summation convention where repeated indices are
summed over.  Parenthesis are shorthand for the fully symmetric sum
%
\begin{equation*}
A_{(\alpha\beta)}
= \frac{1}{2} \left(A_{\alpha\beta} 
+ A_{\beta\alpha} \right)
\end{equation*}
%
and square brackets are fully antisymmetric
%
\begin{equation*}
A_{[\alpha\beta]}
= \frac{1}{2} \left(A_{\alpha\beta} 
- A_{\beta\alpha} \right)
\end{equation*}
%
We take the signature of spacetime to be $(-1,+1,+1,+1)$.

\noindent Except where otherwise noted we work in geometric units where
$G=c=1$.  We will often measure masses in multiples of the mass of the
sun $1 \msun \approx 1.99 \times 10^{30}$ kg 

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent We define the Fourier transform of a function of time $g(t)$ to be
$\tilde{g}(f)$, where
%
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{g}(f)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t)\, e^{- 2 \pi i f t}\, dt
\end{equation*}
%
and the inverse Fourier transform is
%
\begin{equation*}
g(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(f)\, e^{2 \pi i f t}\, dt
\end{equation*}
%
This convention differs from that used in some gravitational-wave
literature, but is the adopted convention in the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent The time-stamps of interferometer data are measured in
Global Positioning System (GPS) seconds: seconds since 00:00.00 UTC
January 6, 1980 as measured by an atomic clock.
