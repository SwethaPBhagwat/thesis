% % What are gravitational waves, in theory?

Gravitational waves, as predicted by General Relativity, are ripples in the
curvature of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light. 
Like water waves on the ocean, the concept of gravitational wave requires an
ideal, i.e. a smooth and unperturbed background on which the waves 
propagate. Unlike water waves, however, gravitational waves are not the motion 
of a material medium, but are ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself.
The phonemena can be intuitively described with an analogy to electromagnetism. 
When an electromagnetic wave is incident upon a charged particle, it 
accelerates the particle in a direction transverse to its own direction
of propagation. This acceleration depends on the electric charge 
and the inertial mass of the particle.
Incident gravitational waves, similarly, produce an acceleration that is 
transverse to their direction of propagation; with the difference that the 
acceleration produced is independent of the mass of the particle experiencing
it and will be the same for any particle at that point. 
Free falling particles also exerience the same acceleration, and an observer
sitting in their frame, also known as a local inertial frame,
will not be able to measure the local acceleration. 
It is only through non-local measurements between points that are separated 
in spacetime that one would be able to discern the effect of a passing 
gravitational wave.

% % How do we know they exist? Why are they difficult to detect? 

Gravitational waves carry energy away from their source. They couple 
minimally with matter, which allows for the preservation of information from 
distant sources. This will enable us to do precision observation and 
characterization of astrophysical sources. 
On the other hand, the relatively weak coupling with matter also makes them
demonstrably quite difficult to detect directly in a laboratory.
The first indirect detection of gravitational waves was made by Russell Hulse 
and Joseph Taylor, when they discovered a binary system with a pulsating neutron
star PSR 1913+16 in 1974~\cite{hulse}. They observed pulses of radio waves
emitted by the pulsar, and through precise measurement of their timing,
they were able to determine the rate at which the binary orbit was shrinking.
Orbital energy is directly co-related with the separation of the objects in 
the binary, and
their measurement allowed them to calculate the rate at which the binary 
was losing energy. It was soon shown that this rate agreed within a percent
with that predicted by General Relativity~\cite{Weisberg:1981mt,Taylor:1989}.
Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel prize in Physics in 1993 for this 
discovery. In the following years, there have been similar pulsar binaries
have been discovered, allowing for more precise measurements of the effect
of gravitational waves as predicted by General Relativity~\cite{Burgay:2003jj}.


% % What is LIGO trying to do?

Felix Pirani first suggested the use of an interferometer for precise
measurement of the distance between two test masses in 1956~\cite{Pirani:1956}.
In 1971, Moss, Miller and Forward built and tested the first laser
interferometric gravitational wave transducer~\cite{Forward:1971}. The design
of the modern interferometric detectors are built on the contributions 
of Weiss~\cite{Weiss:1972} and Drever~\cite{Drever:1980} from 1970s. The
core of such detectors is a Michelson interferometer, with two laser 
cavities oriented perpendicular to each other. The end mirrors of each 
cavity is held vertically, and are practically freely falling in the 
transverse direction. Incoming gravitational waves will cause different 
changes in the length of each cavity, and these instruments measure with 
great precision the change in the difference in the length of both 
cavities~\cite{Saulson:1995zi}. 
%
There is currently a concerted effort worldwide towards the direct detection 
of gravitational waves, and several ground based gravitational wave observatories 
are being planned and built. These include:
%
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO): This
 United States funded project comprises of two independent detectors, one 
 located in Hanford, Washington and the other in Livingston, Louisiana. 
 \item Virgo observatory: A French-Italian project based in Cascina, Italy.
 \item GEO 600, near Sarstedt, Germany.
 \item The Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA), formerly the Large-scale
 Cryogenic Gravitational-wave Telescope (LCGT), is a Japanese project, and has
 begun construction in the tunnels of Kamioka mines in Japan.  
 \item LIGO-India: This is a tentative project between LIGO and several 
 institutions in India, aimed at having a third LIGO-like instrument in the 
 eastern hemisphere.

The first-generation LIGO and Virgo detectors were constructed in stages, and
began observation in 2002 and 2007, respectively. There were 6 observation 
runs performed with LIGO, called Science run 1 (S1) to Science run 6 (S6). 
During the fifth Science run (S5) in 2007, LIGO reached its design sensitivity and
was sensitive to gravitational waves from systems similar to the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar
up to distances of \FILL Mpc. For comparison, the Virgo supercluster, of which 
our own galaxy is a part, has a diameter of 33~Mpc. In the sixth Science run,
the sensitivity of the instruments was improved by increasing the laser power
in its cavities, adding an output-mode cleaner and implementing other 
technological upgrades. This \textit{enhanced} LIGO operated from July 2009
to October 2010, being sensitive to similar fiducial systems out to $\sim 15$\FILL Mpc. 
Similarly, the Virgo detector observed in 3 Virgo Science Runs
(VSR1-3), extending over late 2007 to 2011. At the peak of their combined 
sensitivity, the three detectors were sensitive to Hulse-Taylor type binaries out 
to \FILL Mpc. While no detection was made, the LIGO-Virgo Scientific Collaboration
(LVC) was able to put upper limits on the rate of compact object binary mergers
within its range. Results from these observation periods have been published 
since, e.g.~\cite{Messaritaki:2005wv,Abadie:2010mt,Abadie:2012rq,Abbott:2009km,
Colaboration:2011nz,Abadie:2010yb,Abbott:2009qj,Abbott:2009tt,Abadie:2011kd,
Aasi:2012rja,Abbott:2003yq,Abbott:2005pu,Sintes:2005fp,Abadie:2011md,
Palomba:2012wn}. 

% % Advanced LIGO
The second generation Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Virgo detectors are currently
under construction and commissioning~\cite{Harry:2010zz,aVIRGO}.
The two aLIGO detectors are expected to begin operation late next year, and
plan to achieve their design sensitivity by 2019~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}. 
The Virgo detector is also being upgraded on a similar timeline. 
These upgrades will increase the sensitivity of both detectors in two 
important ways, (i) provide a factor of 10 improvement in sensitivity 
across the entire LIGO frequency band, and (ii) lower the lower frequency
bound from $40$~Hz down to about $15$~Hz~\cite{Harry:2010zz}. 
These enhancements would mean a thousandfold increase in the volume of the
universe that we would be able to probe for source of gravitational waves. 
Astrophysical estimates and numerical simulations suggest that the Advanced
detectors would detect about 40 mergers a year of Hulse-Taylor type compact
binaries~\cite{LSCCBCRates2010}. 

% % What are compact binaries, and how are they formed?

Gravitational wave astronomy can probe regions that the electromagnetic
spectrum cannot, like black holes, interiors of neutron stars, supernovae
mechanism etc. They also offer the unique avenue of probing gravity in 
the strong-field regime, providing a valuable test of General Relativity.
There are several astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as 
supernovae explosions, cosmic strings, black hole ringdowns, etc. 
Binaries of stellar-mass compact objects are of special interest for 
ground based detectors like LIGO and Virgo as they emit gravitational 
radiation in the operating frequency range of the detectors, which
extends from about 15~Hz to a few kHz. As binary stars evolve and 
undergo supernovae, a significant 
fraction of them get disrupted. The ones that survive form binaries
containing neutron stars and/or black holes. While the mass of neutron
stars are observationally constrained between $1-3\msun$, the upper bound 
on the mass of stellar-collapse black holes is something that can also 
be better determined with gravitational wave observations. 

Searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries operate by 
matched-filtering the detector data to dig out the weak gravitational wave
signatures that are otherwise buried in the instrumental noise. They take 
advantage of the fact that we can theoretically model the expected form of the 
gravitational wave signatures, called \textit{waveforms}, and use those 
as filtering templates. While an exact analytic solution in General Relativity
for the dynamics of compact binary systems has not been found, several perturbative
formalisms exist that are capable of describing the inspiral dynamics.
In the slow-motion large-separation post-Newtonian (PN) 
approximation~\cite{PNtheoryLivingReviewBlanchet},
various orbital quantities are calculated as Taylor series in the binary 
velocity parameter $v$ (normalized by the speed of light). 
There exist careful resummation techniques, e.g. within the Effective-One-Body
(EOB) framework~\cite{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour}, 
that are built on PN theory results and extend them to the
strong-field fast-motion regime which the binary enters close to its merger.
For binaries where one body is substantially more massive than the other, 
the recently developed self-force (SF) formalism proves to be 
accurate~\cite{grallaI,grallaII}. 
On the other hand, there has been tremendous progress recently in Numerical
Relativity, which includes high-accuracy numerical simulations of binary black
hole mergers in non-perturbative General Relativity. The field saw the first
breakthrough simulations in 2005 by Frans Pretorius~\cite{Pretorius2005,
Pretorius2006}, the Goddard group~\cite{Campanelli:2005dd} and the research
group at the University of Texas -- Brownville and Florida Atlantic 
University~\cite{Campanelli:2005dd}. More recently, the Simulating eXtreme
Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration~\cite{SXSWebsite} between California Institute
of Technology, Cornell University, Canadian Institute of Theoretical 
Astrophysics, and the California State University at Fullerton has made rapid
progress in increasing the stability and efficiency of the numerical 
methods involved in simulating mergers of black holes~\cite{Mroue:2013xna}.
Owing to the computational complexity of these simulations, they are available 
only for a restricted set of binay configurations. 
The information from these simulations is traditionally used to calibrate
semi-analytic waveform models~\cite{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, as well as purely
phenomenological closed-form models~\cite{Santamaria:2010yb}. 
There has also been concerted progress in including the effect of the 
internal matter structure of the neutron stars in binaries, 
e.g.~\cite{Deaton:2013sla}, and in simulating other matter systems,
e.g. supernovae~\cite{Mosta:2014jaa}.
In this dissertation, we will restrict ourselves to systems in vacuum, 
neglecting possible matter effects. 

With its increasead sensitivity, the Advanced detectors will need more accurate
waveform templates as well as better methods for efficiently using those to 
filter out the noise from true gravitational wave signals. 
The goal of the research presented in this dissertation is to construct, and
improve the techniques of using waveform templates in gravitational wave searches. 
The rest of the dissertation is organized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:theory}, I describe the production of gravitational
 waves from compact binaries, and its effect on the interferometric detectors.
 \item In chater~\ref{ch:ligo}, I discuss the construction of terrestrial 
 interferometers like LIGO, and their response to incident gravitational waves.
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:EOBF2_Effectualness} 
 I study the importance of the accuracy of the PN theory in the predictive 
 modeling of the late-inspiral of binaries. We estimate the range of binary 
 parameters where the weak-field slow-motion PN theory is accurate and 
 sufficient for aLIGO filter templates.
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:NRHyb_bank}, I study the possibility of using a
 restricted set of accurate Numerical Relativity simulations as filter template
 in aLIGO searches. 
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:ninja2}, I describe work done as part of the 
 NINJA-2 project. This involved using accurate NR waveforms as simulated
 signals embedded in LIGO noise that is recolored to aLIGO sensitivity, in
 order to test different search algorithms that are being developed by the
 LIGO-Virgo collaboration.
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:insSFIMRI}, I describe a waveform model that we 
 developed using recent calculations in the self-force picture. This model 
 suffices to describe the inspiral dynamics of compact binaries with 
 $m_1/m_2\gtrsim 6$.
 \item In chapter~\ref{ch:imrSFIMRI}, I describe a waveform model that 
 completes the one described in the chapter~\ref{ch:insSFIMRI} by extending to 
 and accurately capturing the late-inspiral, plunge and merger phases of 
 compact binary coalescence. 
 \item Finally, chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions} is a summary of the conclusions
 from the research presented in this work.
\end{enumerate}
