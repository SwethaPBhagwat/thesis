- The authors provide clear and extensive background on their work, but very little motivation. On the third paragraph of page 2 they introduce the purpose of their paper: "In this paper, we propose the use of purely NR and NR-PN
hybrid waveforms as search templates in GW searches." But they do not say why one would wish to do this. Sufficiently accurate waveform models exist for searches (EOBNR being one that is used in this study), and no motivation is given why one would use NR (or PN-NR hybrids) instead.

A:
This paper is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of using numerical 
waveforms as templates, with the aim of extending it to spin aligned binaries.
Waveform models, such as EOB models, use fitted resummations of perturbative
expressions for metric coefficients, waveform multipoles etc, to extrapolate
the information from PN calculations to the late-inspiral regime, after
mapping to an equivalent single body problem. The models are calibrated to a
given set of mass-ratios, and interpolated or extrapolated to others.
The intrinsic errors in the waveforms, specifically in the late-inspiral 
portion (before the numerical simulations begin) and for un-calibrated 
mass-ratios, are difficult to put a bound on. 

Hybrids use the post-Newtonian waveforms up to the same late-inspiral 
regime, joined to NR waveforms that cover the later portion. 
While these are not free of waveform errors, we know the source
of the errors is the PN portion due to the yet-unknown higher order terms.
We can put a (conservative) quantitative bound on the hybrid's intrinsic
errors, as we have, and we can and should take it into account while 
constructing effectual banks.

Therefore the benefit of using hybrids is the possibility of bounding
model errors that are taken into account for template banks, without a 
prohibitively large increase in the number of templates (as elaborated
below). For aligned-spin binaries, it is again (more) difficult to 
quantify the modeling errors in the waveform models for the 
late-inspiral phase, while it could be possible to put a bound on 
the intrinsic errors in hybrid templates. 

This has been added to the Introduction section, phrased as follows:
"..IMR waveform models, such as the EOB and phenomeno-
logical models, build on resummed or phenomenological ex-
tensions of results from PN theory. The free parameters in the
models are fitted to extend them to arbitrary values of phys-
ical paraemters. This is done by requiring agreement with
a sample of NR waveforms that cover a few tens of inspiral
cycles before merger. Their intrinsic modeling errors for the
late-inspiral phase, however, are difficult to quantify precisely,
especially for mass (and spin) values to which the models are
interpolated or extrapolated to. On the other hand, we have
hybrid waveforms that are available for a restricted set of bi-
nary masses and spins. Their intrinsic errors arise out of the
yet-unknown higher order PN terms, which become signif-
icant as the characteristic velocity increases. We can put a
(conservative) quantitative bound on these [68, 69]. This al-
lows us to consider the effect of template modeling errors on
the SNR recovery of matched-filtering searches, which could
be significant for stellar mass BBHs.

Therefore we propose the use of purely-NR and NR-PN hy-
brid waveforms as templates in GW searches with aLIGO.
In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of doing so for
non-spinning BBHs, with the aim of extending the method to
spinning binaries in future work. We find that the currently
available hybrids are sufficient to cover a significant portion
of the binary masses, including BBHs with component masses
above 12M . It has been a long standing aim of Numerical
Relativity to provide simulations that can be directly applied
to GW searches. We show that aiming at a complete hybrid
template bank is useful in choosing the physical parameters
for future NR simulations. Towards this aim, we give the set
of mass-ratios for which NR simulations would be required,
and sufficient, for complete non-spinning hybrid banks for
aLIGO. The detectory sensitivity is modeled using the final
design zero-detuning high-power noise curve [103, 104], with
filtering starting at 15 Hz.."

- I do not understand why mismatches are used to evaluate the required length of NR waveforms for template banks. In a search it is the fitting factor of the signals against the template bank that matters most, and for this purpose the work in Ref. 70 suggests that far shorter waveforms are sufficient. Indeed, if waveforms covering ~50 orbits are necessary if they are to be used for template banks, then it is even more important that the need for this kind of approach be motivated much more strongly.

And in the "cite please" category:

-  If Ref. 36 is to be cited for large recoils, then Gonzalez et al, PRL 98 (2007) 231101 must be cited as well. In the list of recent reviews (Refs 55-57), my own review (http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0901.2931) would be a useful addition. Although its list of "current waveforms" is long out of date, it does discuss NR waveform production from the perspective of the needs of gravitational wave astronomy, and is only slightly more out of date than the subsequent NRDA reviews in Refs. 56 and 57.

A: 
Gonzalez et al, PRL 98 (2007) 231101 was already cited there, [37] in the draft.
A citation to arXiv:0901.2931 has been added to the list of recent reviews.
