1. 
a. Please change the fifth sentence of the third paragraph of Section V to:

"The templates are sampled over the total mass and mass-rato $(M, q)$
coordinates, sampling q from the restricted set."

b. In the acknowledgments:

Is it "NSF Award No. PHY-0960291" or "NSF Grant No. PHY-0960291"?

##############################################################################
2. Please replace the relevant sentence, i.e.:

"With a discrete bank of filter templates, 
the SNR we recover
\begin{equation}\label{eq:realoptimalSNR}
 \rho\simeq \Olap(h^{\tr},h_b)\leftn h^{\tr}\rightn = \Olap(h^{\tr},h_b)\,\rho_{\mathrm{opt}},
\end{equation}
where $h_b$ is the filter template in the $b$ank (subscript $b$) that has the
highest overlap with the signal $h^{\tr}$.",

with:

"The SNR $\rho$ recovered with a discrete bank of filter templates is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:realoptimalSNR}
 \rho\simeq \Olap(h^{\tr},h_b)\leftn h^{\tr}\rightn = \Olap(h^{\tr},h_b)\,\rho_{\mathrm{opt}},
\end{equation}
where $h_b$ is the filter template in the $b$ank (subscript $b$) that has the 
highest overlap with the signal $h^{\tr}$.

3. OK

4. Please replace the first sentence in the caption of Figure 11 with:

"The curves show the maximum mismatch between hybrids constructed with 
different PN approximants, at different matching frequencies ($M\omega_m$), as
a function of the binary total mass."

[37] Author name to be changed from "G. Turin" to "G. L. Turin".

[50] All citations to this reference should be replaced with a citation to
reference [68], i.e. Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 241104 (2013). The bibtex entry for
this was created in the bib file before this paper was accepted by Physical
Review Letters for publication, and should have been updated.

[52] Author name to be changed from "H. Pfeiffer" to "H. P. Pfeiffer".

[56] There are two entries for author "H. P. Pfeiffer". Please remove one.

[62] The author list should be changed from "B. Aylott et al." to 
"L. Cadonati et al."; as it appears on 
http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/26/11/114008/
