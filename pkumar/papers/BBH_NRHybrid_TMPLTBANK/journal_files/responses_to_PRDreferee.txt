I have only a few minor remarks:

1) "We find that the EOBNRv2 manifold is a reasonable approximation
for the hybrid manifold." I would suggest alluding to this result
earlier, as while reading the methods I had wondered if the use of
EOBNRv2 to model signals would introduce any uncertainty into the
results.

A: This was mentioned in Sec.III, where we describe the method for
quantification of template bank effectualness (above Eq. 18). I have
added the following text in the Introduction to clarify this point
earlier:

"The bank placement algorithm uses the EOB
model from Ref. [53] (EOBNRv2). As this model was cal-
ibrated against NR for most of these mass-ratios, we expect
the manifold of EOBNRv2 to be a reasonable approxima-
tion for the NR manifold. In Sec. V, we demonstrate that
this approximation holds well for NR-PN hybrids as well. "

2) "... domain pseudospectral code to solve Einsteins equations." ->
Einstein's

A: Changed.

3) In Table I it would be useful to include a columns giving the
lowest mass for which the waveform starts at 15Hz.

4) "And the coverage fraction of the bank is 99%." Coverage fraction
was not defined.

A: Description of the termination condition for the stochastic 
bank construction has been rephrased as:

"The process is repeated till the fraction of 
proposals being accepted falls below $\sim 10^{-4}$, and $\gtrsim 99\%$
of the parameter space is covered effectually."

5) "... pushing their mass-ratios to the two neighboring mass-ratio
from Sq" I suspect it does not matter very much, but was the pushing
done along lines of constant total mass or chirp mass?

A: The uncovered points are pushed to the nearest allowed mass-ratio values
along lines of constant chirp mass. This has been clarified in the paper as: 
"... pushing their mass-ratios to the two neighboring mass-ratios from
$\mathcal{S}_q$ along lines of constant chirp mass"

"... pushing their mass-ratios to the two neighboring mass-ratios from
$\mathcal{S}_q$ along lines of constant chirp mass"

6) "The detectors will be relatively very sensitive to a relatively
short frequency band." This reads a little awkwardly.

A: This has been rephrased as:

"The detector sensitivity will be the highest in a relatively 
short frequency band."

7) "The spacing between neighboring templates is given by requiring
that the overlap between them be 97%. We take the union of these banks
as the final two-dimensional bank." Again I suspect it does not matter
much, but how was the first point along each q line chosen?

A: The first point, i.e. the lowest total mass template, was chosen to
be the one for which the hybrid mismatch is 3\%. As the hybrid mismatches
grow even higher at lower masses, we think it is reasonable to choose the 
first point where the mismatches are almost at the threshold.
This has been clarified as:

"The template with the lowest total mass is chosen by requiring the
 hybrid mismatch to be $3\%$ at that point. The spacing between 
 neighboring templates is given by requiring that the overlap between
 them be $97\%$. We take the union of these banks as the final 
 two-dimensional bank."
