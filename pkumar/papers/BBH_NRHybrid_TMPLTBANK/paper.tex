\title{Binary black hole template banks with Numerical Relativity waveforms.}
\begin{abstract}
Coalescing black hole binaries are expected to be important sources for
detection by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) and Advanced Virgo. With a 10-fold increase in
sensitivity from their initial incarnations, these second generation detectors will 
be able to detect such systems at distances up to a few Gpc. Current searches for
binary black holes (BBHs) use banks of waveforms, modelled using the weak-field
slow-motion post-Newtonian (PN) approximation, as filters with which to
matched-filter the detector data. \red{[HP: This sounds like {\em all} current searches use {\em exclusively} PN templates.  Please clarify wording and remove this red]} These approximate waveforms do not
model the merger phase of the binary's evolution, where strong-field
effects dominate. For massive binaries, the merger will occur in the
sensitive frequency band of LIGO. Recent advances in Numerical
Relativiy (NR) have led to high-accuracy simulations of the
late-inspiral and mergers of BBHs, with fully-numerical solutions of Einstein's field
equations. 
\red{[HP: Note that the rest of abstract is rewritten]}
This paper explores the direct use of NR waveforms for the
  construction of detection banks.  Utilizing only six already
  completed NR simulations for non-spinning BBH systems, we construct
  a template bank that covers mass-ratios $q\le 10$ and chirp-masses
  ${\cal M}_c\gtrsim 28M_\odot$.  Hybridizing these six NR waveforms
  with PN inspiral waveforms, we construct a template bank that covers
  a larger region of the non-spinning parameter space, namely $q\le
  10$ and component masses $m_1,m_2\gtrsim 12M_\odot$.  The region of
  parameter space coverable is limited by the available mass-ratios in
  NR simulations and the truncation error of the post-Newtonian
  waveforms used in the hybrids.  We estimate that 26 NR simulations
  of approximately 50 orbits in length will be needed to construct a
  NR-PN hybrid template covering the complete non-spinning parameter
  space for mass ratios $1 \leq q \leq 10$.  These template banks are
  constructed such that the combined SNR loss from the discrete
  template spacing and the modeling error due to PN truncation error
  is below 3 per cent.
 % Current literature already has simulations available for
 %    mass-ratios $(m1/m2) = \{1,2,3,4,6,8\}$, that span $15-33$
 %    inspiral orbits before merger.  We propose to use gravitational
 %    waves (GWs) extracted from these NR simulations as a detection
 %    bank for LIGO, which is possible down to a total mass between
 %    about 60$M_\odot$ and 100$M_\odot$. To cover this parameter space
 %    at lower masses, one can use hybrid gravitational waveforms, where
 %    NR waveforms have been stitched to PN waveforms, which lowers the
 %    minimum mass to a component mass of about $m_2 = 12M_\odot$. At
 %    lower masses than this, the error between consecutive mass ratios
 %    becomes large, and more NR simulations are necessary. In addition,
 %    the errors within the hybrid waveforms themselves become large due
 %    to unknown higher-order terms in the PN waveforms. We find that we
 %    are able to completely cover the non-spinning parameter space for
 %    mass ratios $1 \leq q \leq 10$ with 26 NR simulations of
 %    approximately 50 orbits in length.
