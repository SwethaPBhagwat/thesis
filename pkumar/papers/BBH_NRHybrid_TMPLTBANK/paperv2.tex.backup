\title{Template Banks for Binary black hole searches with Numerical Relativity waveforms}
\begin{abstract}
  \harald{Gravitational waves (GW) from coalescing stellar-mass black hole
	  binaries (BBH) are expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser
	  Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory and Advanced Virgo.
	  Detection searches operate by matched-filtering the detector data 
	  using a bank of waveform templates.
	  Traditionally, template banks for BBH are constructed from
	  intermediary analytical waveform models which are calibrated
	  against numerical relativity simulations and which can be
	  evaluated for any choice of BBH parameters.  This paper explores
	  an alternative to the traditional approach, namely the
	  construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH
	  simulations.  Using non-spinning BBH systems as an example, we
	  demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be
	  covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms.  We estimate the
	  required number and required length of BBH simulations to cover
	  the entire non-spinning BBH parameter plane up to mass-ratio 10,
	  thus illustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter placement of future numerical simulations.   We
	  derive error bounds which are independent of analytical waveform
	  models; therefore, our formalism can be used to independently test
	  the accuracy of such waveform models. The resulting template banks 
	  are suitable for advanced LIGO searches. }

Coalescing binaries of stellar mass black holes are promising sources for
the second-generation Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave 
Observatory (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV).
Searches for gravitational-waves (GW) 
matched-filter the detector data using a discrete set of modeled 
waveform templates as filters. This collection of filters is called a
template bank. Traditionally, template banks for BBH are constructed from
intermediary analytical waveform models which are calibrated
against numerical relativity simulations and which can be
evaluated for any choice of BBH parameters. 
In this paper we demonstrate the direct use of NR
waveforms and hybrids derived from them as search templates. We focus
on non-spinning binaries to demonstrate the method, and find exactly
what mass range can existing simulations be used to cover, and which 
simulations would we need to extend to the full non-spinning space.
First, with only six already completed non-spinning NR simulations, 
we construct a template bank that covers mass ratios $1\leq q\le 10$ 
and chirp-masses ${\cal M}_c\gtrsim 27M_\odot$. Second, hybridizing 
these six NR waveforms with Post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms, 
we construct template banks that cover a larger region of the 
non-spinning parameter space, namely $q\le 10$ and component masses 
$m_{1,2}\gtrsim 12M_\odot$. Both of these banks can be used directly 
in searches with the advanced detectors. 
Finally, we demonstrate that this method can be used to guide the 
placement of future NR simulations to ensure that they cover the 
parameter space of interest. We show that 26 NR simulations of 
approximately 50 orbits in length will be sufficient to construct complete
hybrid template banks that will cover mass ratios $1 \leq q \leq 10$, 
down to $m_1+m_2\gtrsim 12M_\odot$.
These template banks are constructed such that the combined SNR loss 
from the discrete template spacing and the modeling error due to PN 
truncation error stays strictly below $3.5\%$.}

\section{Waveforms}\label{s1:waveforms}

In the sections that follow, we will describe the construction of template 
banks for NR or NR-PN hybrid waveform templates. The NR waveforms that we
use correspond to mass ratios $q=\{1,2,3,4,6,8\}$, and were simulated using
the SpEC code~\cite{spec}. The construction of hybrid
waveforms involves joining a long inspiral portion, modeled using PN theory,
to the merger-ringdown waveform from NR. In this section we describe both, the 
NR waveforms and the PN models used in our study. Measuring the effectualness
of these banks involves simulating a population of BBH signals. We use the 
recently published EOBNRv2 model~\cite{BuonannoEOBv2Main} to obtain waveforms
for BBHs with arbitrary masses. This model was calibrated against five out of 
the six NR simulations we use to construct our banks, and is expected to be 
faithful at comparable mass ratios~\cite{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. In this section, 
we briefly summarize the construction of EOBNRv2 waveforms as well.
