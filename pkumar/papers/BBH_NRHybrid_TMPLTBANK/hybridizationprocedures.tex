The hybridization procedure used for this investigation is described in Sec.~3.3 of Ref.~\cite{MacDonald:2011ne}: The PN waveform, $h_\text{PN}(t)$, is time and phase shifted to match the NR waveform, $h_\text{NR}(t)$, and they are smoothly joined together in a GW frequency interval centered at $\omega_m$ with width $\delta\omega$: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:omega_match}
\omega_m-\frac{\delta\omega}{2} \le \omega \le \omega_m+\frac{\delta\omega}{2}.
\end{equation}
This translates into a matching interval $t_{\rm min}<t<t_{\rm max}$ because the GW frequency continuously increases during the inspiral of the binary. As argued in Ref.~\cite{MacDonald:2011ne}, we
choose $\delta\omega = 0.1\omega_m$ because it offers a good compromise of suppressing residual oscillations in the matching time, while still allowing $h_\text{PN}(t)$ to be matched as closely as possible to the beginning of $h_\text{NR}(t)$.

The PN waveform depends on a (formal) coalescence time, $t_c$, and phase, $\Phi_c$. These two parameters are determined by minimizing the GW phase difference in the matching interval $[t_\text{min}, t_\text{max}]$ as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tcphic_bymin}
t_c', \Phi_c' = \mathrm{ \mathop{arg min}_{t_c, \Phi_c}}\int^{t_{\rm max}}_{t_{\rm min}} \big(
  \phi_{\rm PN}(t;t_c,\Phi_c) - \phi_{\rm NR} (t) \big)^2 \rm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where $t_c'$ and $\Phi_c'$ are the time and phase parameters for the best matching between $h_\text{PN}(t)$ and $h_\text{NR}(t)$, and $\phi(t)$ is the phase of the (2,2) mode of the gravitational
radiation. Since we consider only the (2,2) mode, this procedure is identical to time and phase shifting the PN waveform until it has best agreement with NR as measured by the integral in Eq.~(\ref{eq:tcphic_bymin}). The hybrid waveform is then constructed in the form
\begin{equation}
h_\text{H}(t) \equiv \mathcal{F}(t) h_\text{PN}(t;t'_c,\Phi'_c) + \big[1- \mathcal{F}(t)\big]  h_\text{NR} (t), 
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{F}(t)$ is a blending function defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{F}(t) \equiv 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
  1, &  t < t_{\rm min} \\ 
 \cos^2\frac{\pi(t - t_{\rm min})}{2(t_{\rm max} - t_{\rm min})},\quad\quad &  t_{\rm min}
  \leq t < t_{\rm max} \\ 
  0. & t\geq t_{\rm max}  .
\end{array}
\right.\label{eq:BlendingFunction}
\end{eqnarray}
In this work, we construct all hybrids using the same procedure, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:omega_match})--(\ref{eq:BlendingFunction}), and vary only the PN approximant and the matching frequency $\omega_m$.
