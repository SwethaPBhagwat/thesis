- The authors provide clear and extensive background on their work, but very little motivation. On the third paragraph of page 2 they introduce the purpose of their paper: "In this paper, we propose the use of purely NR and NR-PN
hybrid waveforms as search templates in GW searches." But they do not say why one would wish to do this. Sufficiently accurate waveform models exist for searches (EOBNR being one that is used in this study), and no motivation is given why one would use NR (or PN-NR hybrids) instead.

A:
Traditionally, IMR waveform models, calibrated to agree with NR 
waveforms that span a few tens of cycles before merger, are used as
search templates. Current BBH simulation technology is rapidly making
progress with increasing numbers of longer high accuracy simulations 
becoming available. This paper proposes an alternate to the traditional
approach, by demonstrating the feasibility of using NR/hybrid waveforms
directly as templates. For a proof of principle, we focus on 
non-spinning BBHs at present, but we aim to extend this to spinning 
binaries in future.

The bound we derive for the intrinsic errors of the hybrids is
independent of analytic waveform models. This allows us to have 
reliable estimates of waveform errors, that we argue should be taken
into account when constructing template banks.

This has been added to the introduction, phrased as follows:
"Constructing template banks for gravitational wave searches has
been a long sought goal for NR. Traditionally, intermediary waveform
models are calibrated against numerical simulations and then
used in template banks for LIGO searches~\cite{Abadie:2011kd,
Aasi:2012rja}. In this paper we explore an alternative to this
traditional approach, proposing the use of NR waveforms themselves
and hybrids constructed out of them as search templates.
For a proof of principle, we focus on the non-spinning BBH space, 
with the aim of extending to spinning binaries in future work. We
investigate exactly where in the mass space can the existing NR 
waveforms/hybrids be used as templates, finding that only six 
simulations are sufficient to cover binaries with 
$m_{1,2}\gtrsim 12M_\odot$ upto mass-ratio $10$. This method can
also be used as a guide for the placement of parameters for future
NR simulations. Recent work has shown that existing PN waveforms 
are sufficient for aLIGO searches for 
$M=m_1+m_2\lesssim 12M_\odot$~\cite{CompTemplates2009,Brown:2012nn}.
To extend the NR/hybrid bank coverage down to $M\simeq 12M_\odot$, 
we demonstrate that a total of $26$ simulations would be sufficient.
The template banks are constructed with the requirement that the 
net SNR recovered for any BBH signal should remain above $96.5\%$
of its optimal value. Enforcing this tells that that these $26$ 
simulations would be required to be $\sim 50$ orbits long. This 
goal is achievable, given the recent progress in simulation 
technology~\cite{MacDonald:2012mp,Mroue:2013xna,BelaLongSimulation}. 
Our template banks are viable for GW searches with aLIGO, and the 
framework for using hybrids within the LIGO-Virgo software 
framework has been demonstrated in the NINJA-2
collaboration~\cite{NINJA2:2013inPrep}. In this paper, we also 
derive waveform modeling error bounds which are independent of
analytical models. These can be extended straightforwardly to 
assess the accuracy of such models."

- I do not understand why mismatches are used to evaluate the required length of NR waveforms for template banks. In a search it is the fitting factor of the signals against the template bank that matters most, and for this purpose the work in Ref. 70 suggests that far shorter waveforms are sufficient. Indeed, if waveforms covering ~50 orbits are necessary if they are to be used for template banks, then it is even more important that the need for this kind of approach be motivated much more strongly.

A:
In this paper, we attempt to disentangle the two effects of waveform
modeling errors and template bank sparseness along the mass axes, 
both of which contribute to the net SNR loss. For the first effect,
we choose the conservative method used in MacDonald et al (2012),
to ensure that the resulting banks are conservatively effectual. 
Comparing hybrids from all possible pairs of TaylorTn+NR 
constructions allows us to estimate the hybrid errors independent 
of the PN model formulation and accidental good/bad agreements 
between any particular pair.

And in the "cite please" category:
-  If Ref. 36 is to be cited for large recoils, then Gonzalez et al, PRL 98 (2007) 231101 must be cited as well. In the list of recent reviews (Refs 55-57), my own review (http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0901.2931) would be a useful addition. Although its list of "current waveforms" is long out of date, it does discuss NR waveform production from the perspective of the needs of gravitational wave astronomy, and is only slightly more out of date than the subsequent NRDA reviews in Refs. 56 and 57.

A: 
Gonzalez et al, PRL 98 (2007) 231101 was already cited there, [37] in the draft.
A citation to arXiv:0901.2931 has been added to the list of recent reviews.
