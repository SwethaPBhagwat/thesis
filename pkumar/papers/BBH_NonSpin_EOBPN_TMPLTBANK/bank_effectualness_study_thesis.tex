\begin{abstract}
Mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) are expected to be likely candidates for detection with the second-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors, Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Searches for binary black holes in Initial LIGO/Virgo used discrete banks of frequency domain (Taylor F2) waveform templates based on post-Newtonian (PN) calculations. These templates were placed using the Owen-Sathya hexagonal bank placement metric. We investigate this 2PN accurate bank placement metric for placing a bank of inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform templates approximated with the leading order $(l=2,m=2)$ Effective-One-Body waveform multipole (EOBNRv2) \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. We find that a bank placed using the metric covers $\sim 98.5\%$ of the designated BBH mass-space sufficiently. Subsequently, we numerically investigate the viability of using similar Taylor F2 template banks to search for gravitational waves from stellar-mass BBHs in aLIGO. We find that for BBHs with total mass below $\sim 8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$, such a template bank is viable for detection searches with a loss of no more than $10\% (15\%)$ in the event observation rate. In the absence of knowledge of the exact waveform solution, we assume that the Effective-One-Body model \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, which includes beyond-leading-order multipolar corrections to the emitted gravitational radiation multipoles, accurately models the gravitational waves emitted from such systems. We also investigate the effect of ignoring sub-leading order waveform multipoles in search templates. We find that for systems with $1\leq (m_1/m_2)\leq 1.5 (3.25)$, template banks of EOBNRv2 waveforms incur no more than a $10\% (15\%)$ loss in the event observation rate (at a fixed SNR). For BBHs more massive than $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$ and $(m_1/m_2)\geq 1.5 (3.25)$, detection search pipelines that can efficiently search with EOB waveforms which include sub-leading harmonics should be further investigated \citep{HigherHarmonicsDAsearch}.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:level1:Introduction}
In the last several decades, there has been tremendous progress towards the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). Upgrades to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are currently underway with completion scheduled for 2014. Similar upgrades are scheduled for the second-generation Virgo detector. These advanced detectors will have a factor of ten improvement in strain sensitivity, or equivalently, a thousandfold increase in the observable volume of space \citep{aLIGOsensitivity}, as compared to their first-generation counterparts.

Mergers of binary black holes (BBHs), driven by the emission of gravitational waves, are expected to be an important class of candidate events for detection by advanced interferometric detectors \citep{300yrsofGravitation}. Second-generation detectors will be able to detect GW signals from BBH systems with component masses $(10,10)M_{\odot}$ up to $\sim$2.2Gpc \citep{DamourF2EOB01}. The rate of BBH coalescences that will be observed by the advanced detectors has been estimated to be between $0.2\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $1000\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is substantially higher than for the initial detectors, for which the observation rates were estimated to be between $2\times10^{-4}\,yr^{-1}$ and $0.5\,yr^{-1}$ \citep{LSCCBCRates2010}. Accurate knowledge of what General Relativity (GR) predicts the GW signals from such systems to look like is crucial to extracting information from the detector data, which is otherwise buried under instrumental noise. Past searches for GW signals in the detector data \citep{LSCSearch2004,LSCSearch2005,LSCSearch2008} involved matched-filtering \citep{JolienGWPhysAst} the data with a large number of analytically modeled waveforms that served as matched-filtering templates. This technique is sensitive to the accuracy of the waveform templates that are used as filters [citation], and if the model used to construct search templates does not accurately reproduce the true signals, we lose sensitivity in the detection searches. This necessitates a judicious choice of the waveform model that one would use to model waveform templates with.

There has also been substantial progress in the understanding of BBH dynamics in the recent past. Theoretically, the dynamics of a BBH system can been modeled in three regimes. First, the early adiabatic inspiral, when the separation between the black holes is large and the slow-motion approximation is valid \citep{PNtheoryLivingReviewBlanchet}, can be modeled using results from post-Newtonian (PN) theory. Current literature has PN expressions available for GW phase/amplitude accurate up-to 3.5PN/3PN order \citep{PNFluxEnergy3PN01,KidderPN,Blanchet3PN}, in the context of non-spinning circularized binaries. Second, the late-inspiral and merger phase, when the distance between the BHs becomes comparable to their horizon radius, ending before the merger of the two. Insight into this phase has been provided with full numerical solutions to Einstein's field equations in Numerical Relativity (NR). The analytic Effective-One-Body (EOB) model \citep{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour} uses information from NR to model this phase, and recent development of this model \citep{EOBNR01,EOBNRdevel01,EOBNRdevel02,EOBNRdevel03,EOBNRdevel04,EOBdevel01,EOBdevel02} has resulted in remarkable agreement between EOB(v2) and NR waveforms \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. Finally, the ringdown phase is modeled using a super-position of quasi-normal modes which describe the Kerr black-hole that is formed from the coalescence of the two BHs. This is well understood in Black-Hole Perturbation-Theory (BHPT) \citep{BHRDQNMs,BHPTMinoSasaki}. To generate the waveform templates, one could use PN waveform approximants that model only the inspiral phase, specifically the frequency domain Taylor F2 approximant \citep{JolienGWPhysAst}. The advantage is that we have available in the frequency domain closed-form analytic expressions for the GW phase and amplitude for this model \citep{JolienGWPhysAst}. This greatly reduces the computational cost of the searches, as matched-filtering is done in the frequency-domain and Fourier transforming time-domain waveforms accounts for a sizable portion of the total computational cost of the search. However, one also sacrifices the accuracy of templates as this approximant only models the waveform from the inspiral phase of the BBH dynamics. Instead of PN waveforms, one could use the recently proposed EOB model \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main} (EOBv2), that has been calibrated to NR waveforms for five different values of the mass-ratio. The EOB waveforms are generated in the time domain, and so incur the additional computational cost of a Fourier transform towards the searches. Also, the model incorporates higher order harmonics to construct the final waveform, which introduces additional (computational) complexity that the current search pipelines are not equipped to handle. With these factors in mind, one could prefer to use just the leading order $(l=2,m=2)$ EOBv2 waveform multipole to approximate the complete waveform from such systems. This is a reasonable approximation for comparable-mass systems, when the ratio of the two masses is close to unity, as can be seen from Fig.(1) of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. For such systems, the amplitude of the leading order waveform multipole is a few orders of magnitude higher than the next-to-leading-order waveform multipole. Throughout this paper, an EOBv2 waveform constructed with only the leading order waveform multipole is denoted as EOBNRv2, whereas one that includes sub-leading waveform multipoles will be denoted as EOBNRv2HM.

In addition to modeling inaccuracies, there is another source of loss in event observation rate in detection searches, which is the fact that any real search is done with a finite set of template waveforms. GW signals from BBH depend most sensitively on two parameters, i.e. the component masses of the system. It is important to sample the continuous space of these two parameters sufficiently densely, so that the event observation rate is not significantly impacted. Owen \citep{OwenTemplateSpacing} and Sathyaprakash \citep{SathyaMetric2PN,SathyaBankPlacementTauN} derived a metric in this parameter space, that lets one efficiently place a grid of points in the mass-parameter space with the requirement that not more than a pre-specified fraction of the total events be lost due to the coarseness of the grid. This fraction is specified in terms of minimal match ($\MM$) which is defined as the maximum of inner-product (Sec.\ref{sec:level1:FFStudy}) between a gravitational waveform and the all the waveform templates in the discrete template bank. A set of waveform templates corresponding to the binary systems whose mass parameters are specified by the coordinates of the points on this grid is called a template bank. Detection searches done over the initial LIGO data used template banks of 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveform templates \citep{LSCSearch2004,LSCSearch2005,LSCSearch2008}. These template banks were laid with the criterion that the coarseness of the grid should not lead to more than a $3\%$ loss in recovered SNR, which corresponds to a $10\%$ loss in the event observation rate (assuming that the true GW signals are faithfully modeled by the Taylor F2 approximant). The caveat here is that this bank placement metric was derived using 2PN accurate frequency domain PN waveforms, and its validity for placing a bank of time domain EOB waveforms is not immediately obvious by construction, as it is for 2PN waveforms.

This paper addresses the question of where in the mass-parameter space are template banks of 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms, laid down using the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric with $\MM = 0.97$, suitable for detection purposes in aLIGO. The accuracy criterion that we employ to determine the sufficiency of such a template bank is the Fitting Factor ($\FF$) introduced by Apostolatos \citep{FittingFactorApostolatos}. $\FF$ is a quantity that involves instrument-noise-power weighted inner-products between a true GW signal and each waveform in the entire bank of template waveforms, normalized by the suitably defined norms of the GW signal and the template waveform. This quantity is further explained in Sec.\ref{sec:level1:FFStudy}. An upper threshold of $10\% (15\%)$ loss in detection rate corresponds to a lower threshold of $0.965 (0.947)$ on the $\FF$. We use EOBNRv2HM as a model of the true GW signals. It is useful to note here, that, all throughout this paper, we consider stellar-mass BH to have mass between $(3-25)M_{\odot}$. We find that iLIGO-style template banks of 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms can be viably used detection searches, for BBH whose total mass less than $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$, without a loss in event observation rate that exceeds $10\% (15\%)$. This loss, is the combined loss incurred due to the model inaccuracy and discreteness of the template bank. 

For similar systems, and using the same accuracy criterion, we determine whether the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric is suitable to place template banks of EOBNRv2 waveforms. We calculate the $\FF$ of a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms, constructed with an intended $\MM$ of 0.97, with true GW signals also modeled as EOBNRv2 waveforms. As we model the \textit{true} waveforms with the same model as the template waveform model, any deviation of the $\FF$ from unity will be an artifact of the coarseness of the bank. We find that the $\MM$ of the EOBNRv2 template bank does not fall below 0.97 over 99.8\% [verify] of the stellar-mass BBH region in the mass-parameter space.

Finally, we attempt to answer the question of where in the mass-parameter space will a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms be sufficient for detection searches. The criterion for sufficiency of the bank is the same as for the Taylor F2 case. We find that a $0.97\MM$ template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms, similar to iLIGO, can be viably used to search for BBH for which $1\leq \l(m_1/m_2\r) 1.5 (3.25)$ with $\leq 10\% (15\%)$ loss in event observation rate due to model inaccuracy and discreteness of the bank. This is consistent with what we expect, as the leading order $(l=2,m=2)$ waveform multipole is a good approximation to the complete waveform for comparable-mass BBH systems, and would be inadequate to describe waveforms from BBH systems with large values of $q\equiv m_1/m_2$. For BBH with $q\geq 1.5 (3.25)$, detection searches could gain sensitivity by the use of EOBNRv2HM waveforms. Since current search pipelines are not equipped to search with these waveforms, this also means that work will need to be done to develop search pipelines that will be able to use EOBNRv2HM waveforms efficiently.

This paper is organized as follows:
Sec.\ref{sec:level1:WaveformApproximants} provides a brief overview of the PN results (Sec.\ref{sec:level2:PNApproximants}), and the construction details of the Taylor F2 (Sec.\ref{sec:level3:TaylorF2}) and EOB (Sec.\ref{sec:level2:EOBNRv2}) waveforms that are used in our study. In the beginning of Sec.\ref{sec:level1:FFStudy}, we describe the fitting-factor $\FF$ that we use as the template bank accuracy criterion. Sec.\ref{sec:level2:EffectualnessTaylorF2} and Sec.\ref{sec:level2:EffectualnessEOBNRv2} illustrate the results of the Monte-Carlo study to determine the region of the BBH component-mass space where detection searches can viably employ 3.5PN Taylor F2 and EOBNRv2 waveform template banks, respectively. In Sec.\ref{sec:level2:EOBNRv2templateplacement} we present the results of the Monte-Carlo study where we study the efficiency of the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric in laying down a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms. Finally, the main conclusions of the study are presented in Sec.\ref{sec:level1:conclusion}.


\section{Waveform Approximants}\label{sec:level1:WaveformApproximants}

\subsection{PN Approximants}\label{sec:level2:PNApproximants}
In this section, we present the basic equations that describe the dynamics of PN waveforms. In the adiabatic approximation, we can visualize the course of inspiral as a series of radially shrinking circular orbits. 
The radial coordinate evolves as the binary loses energy to gravitational radiation propagating outwards from the system.
For a binary with individual component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ and total mass $M=m_1+m_2$, the conserved energy accurate to 3PN
can be written as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{eq:E3PN}
E_3(v)=&-\dfrac{1}{2}\eta v^2 \left[1- \l(\dfrac{3}{4}+\dfrac{1}{12}\eta\r)v^2 - \l(\dfrac{27}{8}-\dfrac{19}{8}\eta\right.\right.\\
+&\left.\left.\dfrac{1}{24}\eta^2 \r)v^4 - \l(\dfrac{675}{64}-\l(\dfrac{34445}{576}-\dfrac{205}{96}\pi^2\r)\eta\right.\right.\\
+&\left.\left.\dfrac{155}{96}\eta^2 +\dfrac{35}{5184}\eta^3\r) v^6\right],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\eta=m_1m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2$, $v=(\pi Mf)^{1/3}$ is the characteristic velocity of the binary, and $f$ denotes the frequency of the emitted gravitational wave throughout.
The gravitational flux from such a system, accurate to 3.5PN \citep{FluxandE3-5PN} is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{eq:Ft3.5PN}
F_{3.5}(v)=&\dfrac{32}{5}\eta^2 v^{10}\left[1 - \l(\dfrac{1247}{336}+\dfrac{35}{12}\eta\r)v^2+4\pi v^3\right.\\
-&\left.\l(\dfrac{44711}{9072}-\dfrac{9271}{504}\eta -\dfrac{65}{18}\eta^2 \r)v^4\right.\\
-&\left.\l(\dfrac{8191}{672}+\dfrac{583}{24}\eta\r)\pi v^5+ \l(\dfrac{6643739519}{69854400}\right.\right.\\
+&\left.\left.\dfrac{16}{3}\pi^2 -\dfrac{1712}{105}\gamma +\l(\dfrac{41}{48}\pi^2 -\dfrac{134543}{7776}\r)\eta \right.\right.\\
-&\left.\left.\dfrac{94403}{3024}\eta^2 -\dfrac{775}{324}\eta^3 -\dfrac{856}{105}\textrm{log}(16v^2)\r)v^6\right.\\ 
-&\left.\l(\dfrac{16285}{504}-\dfrac{214745}{1728}\eta -\dfrac{193385}{3024}\eta^2 \r)\pi v^7\right],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is Euler's constant. In the limit $\dot{\omega}/\omega \ll 1$, we can approximate the energy of the system to be the energy averaged over a period. Combining the energy balance equation, $\D E(v)/\D t = -F(v)$, with Kepler's law gives a system of coupled differential equations for the evolution of the orbital phase,
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01}
\begin{align}
\dfrac{\D\phi}{\D t} - \dfrac{v^3}{M} &= 0,\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01_01}\\
\dfrac{\D v}{\D t} + \dfrac{F(v)}{M\l(\D E/\D v\r)} &= 0.\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01_02}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
We can rewrite these eqs. in integral form as follows,
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02}
\begin{align}
t(v) &= t_{\refr} + M\Int_v^{v_{\refr}}\D v\dfrac{E^{\prime}(v)}{F(v)},\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02_01}\\
\phi(v) &= \phi_{\refr} + \Int_v^{v_{\refr}}\D v\,v^3\dfrac{E^{\prime}}{F(v)};\label{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02_02}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $t_{\refr}$ and $\phi_{\refr}$ are integration constants and $v_{\refr}$ is an arbitrary reference velocity.
We can use these constants to set the appropriate initial conditions for the generation of the inspiral.
%\subsection{Taylor T1}\label{sec:level3:Waveform:T1}
%If we substitute the expressions for the Energy of and flux from a particular system, exactly as they are from Eq.\eqref{eq:E3PN},\eqref{eq:Ft3.5PN} into Eq.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01}, and numerically solve it, the phase evolution thus obtained gives us the T1 waveform.
%
%Truncating the expression for Energy and flux at $n$PN order\citep{FluxandE3-5PN,PNFluxEnergy2PN,PNFluxEnergy3PN01,PNFluxEnergy3PN02}, results in a $n$PN template model\citep{CompTemplates2001,GW2PN}.
%
%The initial conditions for the inspiral are specified in terms of a particular starting gravitational wave frequency ($f_{start}$). This is incorporated by putting:
%\begin{align*}
%t_{ref} &= 0\\
%v_{ref} &= (\pi M f_{start})^{1/3}\\
%\phi_{ref} &= 0 \texttt{or} \pi/2
%\end{align*}
%
%giving us a pair of orthogonal templates, one corresponding to each value of $\phi_{ref}$.

%\subsubsection{Taylor T3}\label{sec:level2:TaylorT3}
%We start with explicitly inverting Eq.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02_01} to obtain $v(t)$, as a function of
%\begin{equation}
% \Theta = \l(\dfrac{v(t_{\refr}-t)}{5M}\r)^{-1/8}.
%\end{equation}
%From $v(t)$, we get $f(t)\equiv v(t)^3/(\pi M)$, which is the gravitational wave frequency at any instant of time during the course of the inspiral.
%The expression for $v(t)$ can be substituted in Eq.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02_02} to obtain $\phi(t)$. After this series of operations,
%we obtain the Taylor T3 gravitational phase and frequency as a function of time,
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%\phi^{(T3)}_n(t) &= \phi^{(T3)}_{\refr} + \phi^t_n\Sum^{2n}_{k=0}C^{\phi}_k \Theta^k,\\
%f^{(T3)}_n(t) &= f^t_n\Sum^{2n}_{k=0}C^f_k \Theta^k,\label{eq:T3frequency}
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%where $C^{\phi}_k$, $C^f_k$, $\phi^t_n$ and $f^t_N$ are constants,
%and the subscript $n$ stands for the post-Newtonian order to which the respective expression is accurate.
%Complete expressions for $\phi^{(T3)}_n(t)$ and $f^{(T3)}_n(t)$ can be obtained from Ref.\citep{CompTemplates2009}.
%To setup the initial conditions, one can solve Eq.\eqref{eq:T3frequency} for $t_{\refr}$, such that\newline
%$f^{(T3)}_n(0)=f_{\start}$.

%\subsubsection{Taylor T4}\label{sec:level2:TaylorT4}
%This approximant was originally proposed in Ref.\citep{TaylorT4Origin} and developed subsequently \citep{NRPNComparisonBaker2007,NRdynamicsq1,NRPNComparisonBoyleetal}.
%We substitute the expression for energy from Eq.\eqref{eq:E3PN}, and the expression for flux from Eq.\eqref{eq:Ft3.5PN} into Eq.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01_02},
%and expand $F(v)/ME^{\prime}(v)$ upto consistent PN order \citep{FluxandE3-5PN,PNFluxEnergy2PN,PNFluxEnergy3PN01,PNFluxEnergy3PN02,CompTemplates2001,GW2PN}.
%The Eqns.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01} can subsequently be numerically solved to obtain the phase and gravitational-wave frequency as functions of time.
%Thus we obtain the Taylor T4 phase evolution. The initial conditions for the inspiral are specified in terms of a particular starting gravitational-wave
%frequency ($f_{\start}$). This is incorporated by putting
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%t_{\refr} &= 0,\\
%v_{\refr} &= (\pi M f_{\start})^{1/3},\\
%\phi_{\refr} &= 0\quad \textit{or}\quad \pi/2;
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%giving us a pair of orthogonal templates, one corresponding to either value of $\phi_{\refr}$.

\subsubsection{Taylor F2}\label{sec:level3:TaylorF2}
Using the stationary phase approximation \citep{MatthewsWalker}, the gravitational waveform in the Fourier domain can be approximated as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\tilde{h}(f) &= \dfrac{a(t(f))}{\sqrt{\dot{f}(t(f))}}e^{\ii \l(\Psi_f(t(f)) - \pi/4\r)},\\
\Psi_f(t) &\equiv 2\pi ft - 2\phi(t);
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $t(f)$ is the time at which the orbital frequency of the binary is equal to $f/2$. The expression for $t(f)$ (or $t(v)$) can be taken from Eq.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution02_01}. The phase $\Psi_f$ can be obtained from re-writing Eqns.\eqref{eq:PNOrbitalEvolution01} in the frequency domain,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eq:PNF2Evolution01}
\dfrac{\D\Psi}{\D f}-2\pi t &= 0,\\
\dfrac{\D t}{\D f} + \dfrac{\pi M^2}{3v^2}\dfrac{E^{\prime}(v)}{F(v)} &=0.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These relations represent the Taylor F2 waveform, and the gravitational strain in the frequency domain $\tilde{h}(f)$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{h}(f) = Af^{-7/6}e^{\iota\Psi(f)},
\end{equation}
keeping leading-order amplitude terms. The amplitude $A\propto (m_1+m_2)^{5/6}\eta^{1/2}/\mathcal{R}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the distance to the binary. The phase of the waveform at 3.5PN order is given by 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{eq:PsiSPA}
\Psi(f)=&2\pi ft_c-\phi_c-\dfrac{\pi}{4} + \dfrac{3}{128}\dfrac{1}{\eta}v^{-5}\left[1 + \l(\dfrac{3715}{756} +\dfrac{55}{9}\eta\r)v^2\right.\\
-&\left. 16\pi v^3+\l(\dfrac{15293365}{508032}+\dfrac{27145}{504}\eta +\dfrac{3085}{72}\eta^2 \r)v^4\right.\\

The initial conditions are set by starting the waveform from a given gravitational-wave frequency $f=f_{\start}$.

\subsection{Effective-One-Body Approximant}\label{sec:level2:EOBNRv2}
The dynamics of a two-body system, can be mapped onto an effective-mass moving in a deformed Schwarzschild-like background, and is accomplished by the EOB approach \citep{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour}. With recent advancement in NR, the EOB scheme has benefited substantially \cite{EOBdevel01,EOBdevel02,EOBNRdevel03,DamourFluxhlm01,EOBNRdevel01}. The EOB model proposed recently in Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, has been calibrated to NR waveforms for comparable mass binaries. In this section we summarize the essential features of the model. Throughout, we will use dimensionless units for all physical quantities, i.e., we set $G=c=1$.

\subsubsection{The Hamiltonian}\label{sec:level3:EOBNRv2:Hamiltonian}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe the effective and real hamiltonians. Describe the tuned parameters in the metric.}
The EOB approach maps the fully general-relativistic dynamics of the two-body system to that of an \textit{effective} mass moving in a deformed Schwarzschild spacetime \citep{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour}. The physical dynamics is contained in the deformed-spacetime's metric coefficients, the EOB Hamiltonian \cite{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour}, and the radiation-reaction force. Let $m_1$ and $m_2$ denote the masses of the two components of the binary system, with $m_1$ being the larger of the two. We define the total mass $M$, the reduced mass $\mu$ and the symmetric mass-ratio $\eta$, as
\begin{equation}
M = m_1 + m_2, \,\,\mu =\dfrac{m_1m_2}{M},\,\, \eta = \dfrac{\mu}{M}.
\end{equation}
In polar coordinates $(r,\Phi)$, the EOB metric is written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dsEOB}
\D s_{\eff}^2 = -A(r)\D t^2 + \dfrac{A(r)}{D(r)}\D r^2 + r^2\left(\D\Theta^2 + \sin^2\Theta \D\Phi^2\right).
\end{equation}
The geodesic dynamics of the \textit{effective} mass $\mu$ in the background of Eq.~\eqref{eq:dsEOB} is described by the Hamiltonian $H^{\eff}$ \citep{EOBEffHamiltonian}, which can be written as \citep{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
H^{\eff} =& \mu\hat{H}^{\eff} \\
         =& \mu\sqrt{A(r) \left( 1 +  \dfrac{A(r)}{D(r)}p_r^2 + 2(4 - 3\eta)\eta \dfrac{p_r^4}{r^2} + \dfrac{p^2_{\Phi}}{r^2} \right)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $(p_r,p_{\Phi})$ are momenta conjugate to $(r,\Phi)$ respectively. It was found convenient to replace the radial momentum $p_r$, with the momentum conjugate to the EOB extension of the Regge-Wheeler \textit{tortoise} radial coordinate $r_*$, where $r_*\equiv\int\sqrt{D(r)}/A(r)\,\D r$ \citep{DamourNQC01} . This momentum coordinate $p_{r_*}$ is related to $p_r$ as
\begin{equation}
p_{r_*} = \dfrac{A(r)}{\sqrt{D(r)}}\,p_r.
\end{equation}
In $\l(r,\Phi,p_{r_*},p_{\Phi}\r)$ coordinates, the effective Hamiltonian can be re-written as \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main},
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}^{\eff} = \sqrt{p^2_{r_*} + A(r) \left( 1 + 2(4 - 3\eta)\eta \dfrac{p_{r_*}^4}{r^2} + \dfrac{p^2_{\Phi}}{r^2} \right)}.
\end{equation}
The EOB Hamiltonian (labelled the \textit{real} Hamiltonian), that describes the conservative dynamics of the binary,  is related to the effective Hamiltonian as,
\begin{equation}
H^{\real} = \mu\hat{H}^{\real} = \mu\dfrac{1}{\eta} \sqrt{1 + 2\eta (\hat{H}^{\eff} - 1)}.
\end{equation}
The metric coefficients $A(r)$ and $D(r)$ were originally calculated as Taylor expansions \cite{EOBOriginalBuonannoDamour,PadeAD}, and to $n$-PN order they can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
A(r) = \Sum^{n+1}_{i=0} \dfrac{a_i (\eta)}{r^i},\quad
D(r) = \Sum^{n}_{i=0} \dfrac{d_i (\eta)}{r^i};
\end{eqnarray}
where currently $A(r)$ and $D(r)$ are known to 3PN order $\l(n=3\r)$.  The EOB model that we use employs Pade-resummations of the Taylor expansions of these coefficients \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The use of re-summation techniques to express their Taylor expansions as ratios of polynomials was proposed to ensure the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit in the EOB framework \citep{PadeAD}. Their resummed expression are given by \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}
\begin{eqnarray*}
D(r) &=& \dfrac{r^3}{(52\eta - 6\eta^2) + 6\eta r + r^3},\\
A(r) &=& \dfrac{\alpha_0 r^5 + \alpha_1 r^4}{\beta_0 r^5 + \beta_1 r^4 + \beta_2 r^3 + \beta_3 r^2 + \beta_4 r +\beta_5};
\end{eqnarray*}
where,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\alpha_0 &= 32 - 4a_4 - a_5 - 24\eta ,\\
\alpha_1 &= -64 + 12a_4 + 4a_5 + a_6 + 64\eta - 4\eta^2 ,\\
\beta_0 &= 32 - 4a_4 - a_5 - 24\eta ,\\
\beta_1 &= 4a_4 + 2a_5 + a_6 + 16\eta - 4\eta^2 ,\\
\beta_2 &= 8a_4 + 4a_5 + 2a_6 + 32\eta - 8\eta^2 ,\\
\beta_3 &= 16a_4 + 8a_5 + 4a_6 + \left(8a_4 + 2a_5\right)\eta + 32\eta^2 ,\\
\beta_4 &= 4a_4^2 + a_4a_5 + 16a_5 + 8a_6\\ 
             &+ \left(32a_4 - 2a_6\right)\eta + 32\eta^2 + 8\eta^3 ,\\
\beta_5 &= 4a_4^2 + 4a_4a_5 + a+5^2 - a_4a_6 + 16a_6\\
             &+ \left(32a_4 + 16a_5 - 8a_6\right)\eta + 4a_4\eta^2 + 32\eta^3 ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{metric_a4}
a_4 = \left(\dfrac{94}{3} - \dfrac{41}{32}\pi^2\right)\eta.
\end{equation}
The 4PN and 5PN coefficients $a_5$ and $a_6$ were introduced and calibrated \citep{EOBNRdevel01,EOBNRdevel02,EOBNRdevel03,EOBNRdevel04} to ensure that the dynamics agrees closely with NR simulations of comparable mass binaries. The values for $a_5$ and $a_6$ that we use here are those reported in Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, i.e.
\begin{subequations}\label{metric_tunable_coeffs}
\begin{align}
a_5 &= \left(-5.828 - 143.5\eta + 447\eta^2\right)\eta ,\\
a_6 &= 184\eta .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}\label{sec:level3:EOBNRv2:IniCond}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe how one goes from (f0,m1,m2) to (q0,p0)}
To evolve the dynamics of the binary system using the Hamiltonian, we need the initial values for the coordinates $(r,\Phi,p_{r_*},p_{\Phi})$ that the system starts out in. For a generic precessing BBH, an adiabatic expression of radiation-reaction is derived with the approximate picture that the binary inspirals over a sequence of radially shrinking orbits. In the absence of radiation-reaction, the conditions for motion on spherical orbits have been calculated in Ref.\cite{IniConditions-precessing}. We take their non-spinning limit to define the initial configuration of the binary, requiring
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eq:IniHr}
\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial r} &= 0,\\ \label{eq:IniHpr}
\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial p_{r_*}} &= \dfrac{1}{\eta}\dfrac{\D E}{\D t}\dfrac{(\partial^2\hat{H}^{\real}/\partial r\partial p_{\Phi} )}{(\partial\hat{H}^{\real}/\partial p_{\Phi})(\partial^2\hat{H}^{\real}/\partial r^2)}, \\\label{eq:IniHpphi}
\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial p_{\Phi}} &= \hat{\Omega}_0,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\hat{\Omega}_0 = \pi Mf_0$, with $f_0$ being the starting gravitational wave frequency. Simplifying Eq.\eqref{eq:IniHr}, and ignoring the terms involving $p_{r_*}$, as $p_{r_*}\ll p_{\Phi}/r$ in the early inspiral, we get a relation between $p_{\Phi}$ and $r$:
\begin{equation}
p_{\Phi}^2 = \dfrac{r^3A'(r)}{2A(r) - rA'(r)} \\ \label{eq:Inipphi},
\end{equation}
where the prime($'$) denotes $\partial/\partial r$. Substituting this in Eq.\eqref{eq:IniHpphi}, we get the relation:
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{A'(r)}{2r\left(1 + 2\eta\l(\dfrac{A(r)}{\sqrt{A(r)-\frac{1}{2}r\,A'(r)}} - 1\r)\r)} = \hat{\Omega}_0^2.\\ \label{eq:Inir}
\end{equation} 
Thus, between Eq.\eqref{eq:Inir} and Eq.\eqref{eq:Inipphi}, we get the initial values of $(r, p_{\Phi})$, corresponding to the initial gravitational wave frequency $f_0$. These values can be substituted into Eq.\eqref{eq:IniHpr}, to numerically solve for the initial value of $p_{r_*}$, thereby completely specifying the initial coordinates of the binary system. 
%Eq(\ref{eq:IniHpr}) can be expanded to:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\dfrac{\l( \l(1+2\eta\l(\hat{H}_{eff} - 1\r)\r)\dfrac{\partial^2\hat{H}_{eff}}{\partial r^2} - \eta\l(\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}_{eff}}{\partial r}\r)^2 \r) \dfrac{\partial\hat{H}_{real}}{\partial p_{\Phi}}\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}_{real}}{\partial p_{r_*}}}{\l(1+2\eta\l(\hat{H}_{eff} - 1\r)\r) \l(\l(1+2\eta\l(\hat{H}_{eff} - 1\r)\r) \dfrac{\partial^2\hat{H}_{eff}}{\partial r \partial p_{\Phi}} - \eta\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}_{real}}{\partial p_{\Phi}}\dfrac{\partial\hat{H}_{real}}{\partial p_{r_*}} \r) } = \dfrac{1}{\eta}\dfrac{dE}{dt}
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Gravitational Flux}\label{sec:level3:Flux}
Gravitational waves carry energy and angular momentum away from the binary, and the resulting radiation-reaction force $\hat{F}_{\Phi}$ causes the orbits to shrink. This is related to the energy flux as
\begin{equation}
\hat{F}_{\Phi} = -\dfrac{1}{\eta \hat{\Omega}} \dfrac{\D E}{\D t} = -\dfrac{1}{\eta v^3} \dfrac{\D E}{\D t},
\end{equation}
where, $v=(\hat{\Omega})^{1/3}=(\pi Mf)^{1/3}$ and $f$ is the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency. The energy flux $\D E/\D t$ is obtained by summing over the contribution from each term in the multipole expansion of the waveform, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\D E}{\D t} = \frac{\hat{\Omega}^2}{8\pi} \Sum_{l}\Sum_{m} \left|\frac{\mathcal{R}}{M} h_{lm}\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the physical distance to the binary, and $h_{lm}$ are the multipoles of the waveform when it is decomposed in spin weighted spherical harmonic basis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
h_+ - \ii h_{\times} = \dfrac{M}{\mathcal{R}} \Sum^{\infty}_{l=2} \Sum^{m=l}_{m = -l} Y^{lm}_{-2}\, h_{lm},
\end{equation}
where $Y^{lm}_{-2}$ are the spin weighted spherical harmonics, and $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ denote the two orthogonal gravitational wave polarizations. These waveform multipoles depend on the coordinates and their conjugate momenta, and their Taylor expansions were re-summed as products of individually re-summed factors \citep{DamourFluxhlm01}, 
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:hlmdef}
\begin{align}
h_{lm} &= h^F_{lm} N_{lm}\label{eq:hNQC},\\
h^F_{lm} &= h^{(N,\epsilon)}_{lm} \hat{S}_{\eff}^{(\epsilon)} T_{lm} \exp^{\ii\delta_{lm}} (\rho_{lm})^l\label{eq:hNoNQC};
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\epsilon$ is $0$ if $\l(l+m\r)$ is even, and is $1$ otherwise. This factorized-re-summation of the waveform multipoles enhances their agreement with NR waveform multipoles\citep{EOBNRdevel01,EOBNRdevel02,EOBNR01}. The first factor $h^{(N,\epsilon)}_{lm}$ is the re-summation of the Newtonian order contribution, and is given as \citep{DamourFluxhlm01},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hNewtonian}
h^{(N,\epsilon)}_{lm} = \dfrac{M}{\mathcal{R}}\eta\,n_{lm}^{(\epsilon)}\,c_{l+\epsilon}(\eta)\,V^l_{\Phi}\,Y^{l-\epsilon,-m}\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2},\Phi\right).
\end{equation}
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%n^{(\epsilon=0)}_{lm} &= (\ii m)^l \dfrac{8\pi}{(2l+1)!!}\sqrt{\dfrac{(l+1)(l+2)}{l(l-1)}} ,\\
%n^{(\epsilon=1)}_{lm} &= -(\ii m)^l \dfrac{16\pi \ii}{(2l+1)!!}\sqrt{\dfrac{(2l+1)(l+2)(l^2-m^2)}{(2l-1)(l+1)l(l-1)}},
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%and
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%c_{l+\epsilon} &= \left( \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-4\eta} \right)^{l+\epsilon-1} \\
%						&+ (-1)^{l+\epsilon}\left( \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-4\eta} \right)^{l+\epsilon-1},
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
The first two sub-factors $n_{lm}^{\epsilon},\,c_{l+\epsilon}$ are constant scaling factors that depend only on $l$, $m$ and $\eta$ \citep{BuonannoEOBTerms}, and can be obtained from Eqns.[B7 - B8] of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The sub-factor $V_{\Phi}$ captures the dependence of the amplitude of $h^{(N,\epsilon)}_{lm}$ on the characteristic velocity of the binary $v$, such that 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
V_{\Phi}^l &= v_{\Phi}^{(l+\epsilon)},\quad &(l,m) \neq (2,1) , (4,4),\\
V_{\Phi}^l &= \dfrac{1}{r_{\Omega}}v_{\Phi}^{(l+\epsilon-2)},\quad &(l,m) = (2,1) , (4,4);
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where,
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{\Phi} \equiv & v^3 r_{\Omega},\\
r_{\Omega} \equiv & r\left[ \dfrac{2\left(1+2\eta\left(\sqrt{A(r)(1+p_{\Phi}^2/r^2)} -1 \right) \right)}{r^2dA(r)/dr} \right]^{1/3}.
\end{eqnarray}
This term is expressed differently for $(l,m)=(2,1)$, $(4,4)$ for reasons given in Sec. III E of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The last sub-factor in Eq.\eqref{eq:hNewtonian} is the scalar spherical harmonic term $Y^{l,m}$ that captures the dependence of the multipole on the orbital phase $\Phi$.

The second factor in Eq.\eqref{eq:hNewtonian}, $\hat{S}_{\eff}^{(\epsilon)}$, is the source term, whose definition comes from the EOB formalism \citep{DamourFluxhlm01,BuonannoEOBTerms}. This source term is given by the mass or the current moments \citep{BuonannoEOBTerms} of the binary,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{S}_{\eff}^{(\epsilon=0)} &= \hat{H}^{\eff}(r,p_{r_*},p_{\Phi}) ,\\
\hat{S}_{\eff}^{(\epsilon=1)} &= \hat{L}_{\eff} = p_{\Phi} v.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The \textit{tail term} $T_{lm}$ is the re-summation of the leading order logarithmic terms that enter into the transfer function of the near-zone multipolar waves to the far-zone \citep{BuonannoEOBTerms},
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T_{lm} =& \dfrac{\Gamma(l+1-2\ii m\,\eta\,\hat{H}^{\real}\hat{\Omega})}{\Gamma(l+1)} \exp\left[\pi\,m\,\eta\,\hat{H}^{real}\hat{\Omega}\right]\\
             &\times  \exp\left[ 2\ii\,m\,\eta\,\hat{H}^{\real} \hat{\Omega}\mathrm{log}_e(4\,m\,\hat{\Omega}/\sqrt{e}) \right];
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. The sub-leading dephasing effects between the near-zone and the far-zone waves are re-summed into $\delta_{lm}$ \citep{BuonannoEOBTerms}. The values for $\delta_{lm}$ can be read off from Eqns. [B1a-B6d] of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The last term $\rho_{lm}$ is the complex ratio of the PN expansions of $h_{lm}$ to the product of all other factors of $h^F_{lm}$, given in Eq.\eqref{eq:hNoNQC}. For different values of $l$ and $m$, the expressions for $\rho_{lm}$ are given in Eqns.[B9a - B14g] of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The model also introduces higher-order PN corrections for $\delta_{lm}$ and $\rho_{lm}$, i.e. $\rho^{(6)}_{21}$,$\rho^{(6)}_{33}$,$\rho^{(6)}_{44}$,$\rho^{(6)}_{55}$,$\delta^{(7)}_{21}$,$\delta^{(7)}_{33}$,$\delta^{(5)}_{44}$ and $\delta^{(5)}_{55}$ as they appear in Eqns.[B9b,B10a,B11a,B12a,B1b,B2a,B3a,B4a] of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. These parameters were calibrated, such that the resulting EOB waveform multipoles reproduce their NR counterparts, with good accuracy both in amplitude and phase. The terms introduced in $\rho_{lm}$ help tune the amplitude of the $(l,m)$ multipole, and those in $\delta_{lm}$ were calibrated to match the phase of the $(l,m)$ multipole with its NR counterpart. As these parameters were calibrated in Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main} to ensure that the final waveform multipole, obtained \textit{after} the dynamics has been generated, agrees well with its NR counterpart, they are all set to zero in the calculation of energy flux while generating the EOB dynamics.

The last term in $h_{lm}$, $N_{lm}$ attempts to capture the non-circularity of the quasi-circular orbits,
\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{eq:Nlmdef}
N_{lm} =& \left[1 + \dfrac{p_{r_*}^2}{(r\hat{\Omega})^2} \left( a_1^{h_{lm}} + \dfrac{a_2^{h_{lm}}}{r} + \dfrac{a_3^{h_{lm}}}{r^{3/2}} \right)\right] \\
&\times \exp\left[\ii \left( b_1^{h_{lm}} \dfrac{p_{r_*}}{r\hat{\Omega}} + b_2^{h_{lm}} \dfrac{p_{r_*}^3}{r\hat{\Omega}} \right) \right],
\end{split}\end{equation}
where $(r,p_{r_*})$ are the radial coordinate and momentum conjugate to the \textit{tortoise} radial coordinate, and $\hat{\Omega}$ is the dimensionless instantaneous orbital frequency. While calculating the energy flux, following the prescription of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, we set
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
a_1^{h_{22}} &= -4.559 + 18.76\eta - 24.23\eta^2, \\
a_2^{h_{22}} &= 37.68 - 201.5\eta + 324.6\eta^2, \\
a_3^{h_{22}} &= -39.6 + 228.9\eta - 387.2\eta^2,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
and $a_i^{h_{lm}}=0$ for $(l,m)\neq(2,2)$, and $b_i^{h_{lm}}=0$, for all pairs of $(l,m)$. This amounts to including the non-quasi-circular corrections only for the leading order $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole in the flux.
 
\subsubsection{Evolution of Dynamics}\label{sec:level3:DynamicalEvolution}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe how, starting from the initial conditions, the entire dynamics is evolved, and how we get hFlm(t)}
With the EOB Hamiltonian and the gravitational flux constructed, we can write the equations of motion,
\begin{eqnarray}
\dfrac{\D r}{\D\hat{t}} &\equiv & \dfrac{\partial \hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial p_r} = \dfrac{A(r)}{\sqrt{D(r)}}\dfrac{\partial \hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial p_{r*}} (r, p_{r*}, p_{\Phi}) ,\\
\dfrac{\D\Phi}{\D\hat{t}} &\equiv & \hat{\Omega} = \dfrac{\partial \hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial p_{\Phi}} (r, p_{r*}, p_{\Phi}) , \\ 
\dfrac{\D p_{r_*}}{\D\hat{t}} &=& -\dfrac{A(r)}{\sqrt{D(r)}} \dfrac{\partial \hat{H}^{\real}}{\partial r} (r, p_{r*}, p_{\Phi}) ,\\
\dfrac{\D p_{\Phi}}{\D\hat{t}} &=& \hat{F}_{\Phi}(r, p_{r*}, p_{\Phi}) ;
\end{eqnarray}
where, $\hat{t}\,(\equiv t/M)$ is time in dimensionless units. Starting from the initial coordinate configuration calculated for a fiducial starting gravitational wave frequency, we numerically integrate these equations to get the evolution of the coordinates and momenta $(r(t),\Phi(t),p_r(t),p_{\Phi}(t))$ over the course of inspiral, until the \emph{light-ring}. In the EOB scheme, the light-ring is defined as the local maximum of the orbital frequency $\hat{\Omega}$. From the coordinate evolution, we also calculate $h^F_{lm}(t)$, which is the analytic expression for the waveform multipole without the non-quasi-circular correction factor (defined in Eq.\ref{eq:hNoNQC}). While generating $h^F_{lm}(t)$ from the dynamics, the values for the free parameters in the expressions for $\delta_{lm}$ and $\rho_{lm}$, are taken from Eqn.[38a-19b] of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}, where they optimize these parameters to minimize the phase and amplitude discrepancy between the respective EOB waveform multipoles and those extracted from NR simulations.

\subsubsection{Constructing the waveform multipoles}\label{sec:level3:hlm}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe how the hFlm is used to get Nlm, and then hlm(t) is calculated.}
The novel feature of the model is the factor $N_{lm}$ in the expression of the waveform multipoles (as in Eq.\eqref{eq:hNoNQC}), that attempts to capture the non-circularity of the orbits as the objects enter the late-inspiral stage where the approximation of treating the orbits as quasi-circular does not quite hold. With this factor, the expression for the waveform multipole is given in Eq.\eqref{eq:hNQC}. It is interesting to note that in previous works \citep{EOBdevel02,EOBNRdevel04}, a factor to similar purpose as $N_{lm}$ was introduced into the expression for the energy flux. Introducing $N_{lm}$ in the expression of the waveform multipoles \citep{DamourNQC01,BuonannoEOBv2Main}, has a dual impact as the multipoles figure both in the equations of motion of the system, and the waveform itself.
%\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{eq:Nlmdef}
%N_{lm} =& \left[1 + \dfrac{p_{r_*}^2}{(r\hat{\Omega})^2} \left( a_1^{h_{lm}} + \dfrac{a_2^{h_{lm}}}{r} + \dfrac{a_3^{h_{lm}}}{r^{3/2}} \right)\right] \\
%&\times \exp\left[\ii \left( b_1^{h_{lm}} \dfrac{p_{r_*}}{r\hat{\Omega}} + b_2^{h_{lm}} \dfrac{p_{r_*}^3}{r\hat{\Omega}} \right) \right],
%\end{split}\end{equation}
From Eq.\eqref{eq:Nlmdef} we observe that there are free parameters $a_i^{h_{lm}}$ and $b_i^{h_{lm}}$, which need to be uniquely determined for each binary system. For each pair of $(l,m)$ we have 5 of these unknown parameters, and so we need 5 conditions to determine them uniquely. It was observed \citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main} that the time at which the orbital frequency peaks $(t^{\Omega}_{\peak})$, coincides with the time at which the amplitude of the dominant mode $|h_{22}|$ peaks $(t^{22}_{\peak})$. The amplitudes of the sub-dominant modes peak slightly after this time. We define this relative time shift $(\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak})$ in the time at which the amplitude of the $(l,m)$ multipole peaks with respect to when the dominant $(2,2)$ mode does as
\begin{equation}
\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak} = t^{lm}_{\peak} - t^{\Omega}_{\peak} = t^{lm}_{\peak} - t^{22}_{\peak},
\end{equation}
where $t^{lm}_{\peak}$ is the time at which the amplitude of the respective multipole peaks. For different values of $(l,m)$, $\Delta t^{lm}_{peak}$ can be read off from Table III in Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. Requiring that: 1) the amplitude of each of the multipoles peak at the time predicted by NR (i.e. at time $t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak}$); 2) that the first and second time-derivatives of the amplitude match the values given by NR (at the time at which the amplitude peaks), gives us the three $a_i^{h_{lm}}$ parameters.  These conditions are summarized in Eqns.\eqref{eq:NQCa1}-\eqref{eq:NQCa3}. Requiring that the first and the second time-derivatives of the complex phase of each multipole match their respective NR counterparts, at the time at which the amplitude of the respective multipole peaks, gives us the remaining two $b_i^{h_{lm}}$ phase parameters (Eqns.\eqref{eq:NQCb1}-\eqref{eq:NQCb2}).
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\left| h^{\EOB}_{lm}(t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak}) \right| &=& \left|h^{\NR}_{lm}(t^{lm}_{\peak})\right|\label{eq:NQCa1},\\
\dfrac{\D\left| h^{\EOB}_{lm} \right|}{\D t}(t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak})  &=& \dfrac{\D\left|h^{\NR}_{lm}\right|}{\D t}(t^{lm}_{\peak})\label{eq:NQCa2},\\
\dfrac{\D^2\left| h^{\EOB}_{lm}\right|}{\D t^2}(t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak})  &=& \dfrac{d^2\left|h^{\NR}_{lm}\right|}{\D t^2}(t^{lm}_{\peak})\label{eq:NQCa3},\\
\omega^{\EOB}_{lm}(t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak}) &=& \omega^{\NR}_{lm}(t^{lm}_{\peak})\label{eq:NQCb1},\\
\dfrac{\D\omega^{\EOB}_{lm}}{\D t}(t^{\Omega}_{\peak}+\Delta t^{lm}_{\peak})  &=& \dfrac{\D\omega^{\NR}_{lm}}{\D t}(t^{lm}_{\peak})\label{eq:NQCb2}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These conditions ensure that the behaviour of each of the waveform multipoles match the behaviour predicted by NR simulations accurately around the maximum of the respective multipole's amplitude. As the ringdown part of the waveform is attached to the inspiral-plunge waveform at this point in time, the conditions on the time-derivative of the amplitude and phase (Eqns.\eqref{eq:NQCa2}-\eqref{eq:NQCa3},\eqref{eq:NQCb2}) also help to ensure consistency in the attachment of the ringdown waveform.
For each pair of $(l,m)$, multiplying $h^F_{lm}(t)$ with $N_{lm}(t)$ gives us $h_{lm}(t)$, which completes the inspiral-plunge part of the waveform.
\subsubsection{Ringdown}\label{sec:level3:RD}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe the ringdown attachment procedure.}
The EOB merger-ringdown waveform is modelled as a sum of $N$ quasi-normal-modes (QNMs) \citep{EOBNRdevel01,EOBNRdevel02,EOBNRdevel04}
\begin{equation}
h_{lm}^{\RD}(t) = \Sum^{N-1}_{n=0}A_{lmn}e^{-\ii\sigma_{lmn}(t-t_{lm}^{\mathrm{match}})},
\end{equation}
where $N=8$ for the model we consider. The matching time $t_{lm}^{\mathrm{match}}$ is the time at which the inspiral-plunge and the ringdown waveforms are attached and is chosen to be the time at which the amplitude of the inspiral-plunge part of $h_{lm}(t)$ peaks (i.e. $t^{lm}_{\peak}$)\citep{EOBNRdevel01,BuonannoEOBv2Main}. The complex frequencies of the modes  $\sigma_{lmn}$  depend on the mass $M_f$ and spin $a_f$ of the BH that is formed from the coalescence of the binary. $M_f$ and $a_f$ are given by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\dfrac{M_f}{M} &= 1 + \l(\sqrt{\frac{8}{9}}-1\r)\eta - 0.4333\eta^2 - 0.4392\eta^3,\\
\dfrac{a_f}{M} &= \sqrt{12}\eta - 3.871\eta^2 + 4.028\eta^3.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These relations are the same as Eqn.(28a-28b) of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. Using the mass and spin of the final BH, the complex frequencies of the QNMs can be obtained from Ref.\citep{BHRDQNMs}, where these were calculated using perturbation theory. 

The complex amplitudes $A_{lmn}$ are determined by a hybrid-comb numerical matching procedure described in detail in Sec.II C of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}. Ending at $t=t_{lm}^{\mathrm{match}}$, a small time interval $\Delta t^{\mathrm{match}}_{lm}$ is taken (see Table III of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}). This time interval is divided evenly into $N-3$ subdivisions. The real and imaginary parts of the inspiral waveform and the merger-ringdown waveform are equated at the $N-2$ points, bounding these $N-3$ subdivisions of the time interval $\left[t_{lm}^{\mathrm{match}}-\Delta t^{\mathrm{match}}_{lm},t_{lm}^{\mathrm{match}}\right]$. At the first and the last point in this time interval, the real and imaginary parts of the time-derivatives of the inspiral waveform and the merger-ringdown waveform are also equated, giving us $2$ more constraints on $A_{lmn}$. With a total of $(N-2)+2=N$ constraints, all the $N$ complex $A_{lmn}$ can be uniquely determined.
With $A_{lmn}$ thus obtained, we can now construct the full $h^{\RD}(t)$.

\subsubsection{Final Waveform}\label{sec:level3:FinalWaveform}
%\textcolor{green}{Describe how h+ and hx are obtained from hlm and ringdown}
We combine the inspiral waveform multipole $h_{lm}(t)$ and the ringdown waveform $h^{\RD}(t)$ to obtain complete inspiral-merger-ringdown EOB waveform $h^{\textrm{IMR}}(t)$,
\begin{equation}
h^{\textrm{IMR}}_{lm}(t) = h_{lm}(t)\Theta(t^{\mathrm{match}}_{lm}-t) + h^{\RD}(t)\Theta(t-t^{\mathrm{match}}_{lm}),
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(x)=1$ for $x\geq 0$, and 0 otherwise. These multipoles are combined to give the two orthogonal polarizations of the gravitational waveform, $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$, 
\begin{equation}
h_+ - \ii h_{\times} = \dfrac{M}{\mathcal{R}} \Sum^{\infty}_{l=2} \Sum^{m=l}_{m = -l} Y^{lm}_{-2}(\iota,\theta_c) h^{\mathrm{IMR}}_{lm},
\end{equation}
where $Y^{lm}_{-2}$, as before, are spin $(-2)$ weighted spherical harmonics, $\iota$ is the inclination angle that the binary's angular momentum makes with the line of sight, and $\theta_c$ is a fiducial phase angle.

In this section we will investigate the effectiveness of the 2PN Owen-Sathya template bank placement metric when used to place EOBNRv2 waveform templates, and the efficacy of the Taylor F2 and EOBNRv2 waveform template banks when used for detection searches. An important question is the criterion we choose to address these questions. To address this issue, we start with introducing a few mathematical concepts which are relevant for our studies. The frequency weighted dot product (overlap) between two waveforms $h_1$ and $h_2$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlap}
(h_1|h_2) \equiv 2\int^{\infty}_0\dfrac{\tilde{h}_1^*(f)\tilde{h}_2(f) + \tilde{h}_1(f)\tilde{h}_2^*(f)}{S_n(f)}\D f,
\end{equation}
where $S_n(f)$ is the power spectral density (PSD) of the instrumental noise in the detector, and $\tilde{h}(f) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}e^{-2\pi\ii ft}h(t)\D t$ is the Fourier transform of the waveform $h(t)$. In this study, we use the Zero-Detuned-High-Power noise PSD estimate for advanced LIGO [citation]. The factor of $S_n(f)$ in the denominator gives more weight to the frequencies at which advanced LIGO will be more sensitive, and thus will have lesser power in the noise fluctuations. Consequently, it also gives less weight to frequencies where the detector will be less sensitive. The normalized overlap between the two waveforms is given by
\begin{equation}
(\hat{h}_1|\hat{h}_2) = \dfrac{(h_1|h_2)}{\sqrt{(h_1|h_1)(h_2|h_2)}}.
\end{equation}
Apart from the two mass-parameters of the binary, this normalized overlap is also sensitive to the relative phase of coalescence $\phi_c$ and to the difference in the time of coalescence $t_c$ between the two waveforms $h_1$ and $h_2$. These two parameters ($\phi_c$ and $t_c$) can be maximize over to get the maximized normalized overlap $\Olap$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:maxnormolap}
\Olap(h_1,h_2) = \underset{\phi_c,t_c}{\mathrm{max}}\,\l(\hat{h}_1|\hat{h}_2(\phi_c,t_c)\r),
\end{equation}
which gives a measure of how  "close" the two waveforms are in the waveform manifold. The mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ between the same two waveforms can thence be written as,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mismatch}
\mathcal{M}(h_1,h_2) = 1 - \Olap(h_1,h_2).
\end{equation}
Given a point $a$ in the BBH component-mass space, let $h^e_a$ be the exact waveform emitted by the BBH system whose component BHs have masses given by the coordinates of the point $a$ . The \textit{Fitting Factor} of a bank of template waveforms (modeled using approximant $\X$) at the point $a$, is defined as the maximum value of maximized normalized overlaps between $h^e_a$ and all members $h^{\X}_b$ of the bank of template waveforms \citep{FittingFactorApostolatos}; i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defFF}
\mathcal{FF}(a,\X) = \underset{b}{\textrm{max}}\,\Olap(h^e_a,h^{\X}_b),
\end{equation}
where $b$ is any element of the set of discrete points in the component-mass space that constitutes the bank. This quantity simultaneously quantifies the loss in recovered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the discreteness of the bank, and the inaccuracy of the template model. The similarly defined quantity $\MM$ (minimal match) quantifies the loss in SNR due to only the discreteness of the bank, as both the \textit{exact} and the template waveform is modeled with the same waveform model, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\MM = \underset{a}{\textrm{max}}\underset{b}{\textrm{max}}\,\Olap(h^{\X}_a,h^{\X}_b),
\end{equation}
where $a$ is any point in the BBH component-mass space, $b$ is any point in the discrete set of points in the template bank, and $\X$ is the waveform approximant. For a detection search that aims at less than $10\% (15\%)$ loss in event detection rate due to the discreteness of the bank and the inaccuracy of the waveform model, we would require a bank of template waveforms that has $\mathcal{FF}$ above $0.965 (0.947)$ over the entire component-mass region covered \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008,CompTemplates2009}.

%\end{figure}

We do a Monte-Carlo simulation over the entire stellar-mass BBH mass region to find regions in the component-mass space where a template bank of Taylor F2 waveforms has $\mathcal{FF}$ above $0.965 (0.947)$. The exact waveform $h^e$ is approximated by the EOBNRv2HM waveform model which sums over five dominant and sub-dominant waveform multipoles (i.e. $h_{22},h_{21},h_{33},h_{44}\&h_{55}$) to construct the final waveform.
The simulation was done by sampling 99,000 points over the designated region of the component-mass space, uniformly distributed in individual component-mass. For each of these points, we generate the EOBNRv2HM waveform for the system with component masses given by the coordinates of the point, starting from the time when the gravitational-wave frequency from the system crosses 15Hz, and ending when the quasi-normal ringing of the final black-hole (formed by the coalescence of the binary) ends. Next, we generate a bank of 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms, gridded using the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric \citep{OwenTemplateSpacing,SathyaBankPlacementTauN,SathyaMetric2PN} to cover the same mass region. This bank is generated with the requirement that the waveform generated at \textit{any} point $j$ in that mass-region will have a maximized normalized overlap $\geq 0.97$ with \textit{at least} one point in the bank; i.e., $\Olap(h^{\X}_j,h^{\X}_k)\geq 0.97$ for at least one point $k$ in the bank ($\X$ stands for Taylor F2 approximant). This is the same as requiring that $\MM=0.97$. We record the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the template bank at all the Monte-Carlo points.

Fig.\ref{fig:match_f2eob_all} shows the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the Taylor F2 template bank at each point in the component-mass space. We observe a distinct region of the component-mass space where the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the bank is higher than $0.965 (0.947)$. To explore in detail the region of the space with total-mass below $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$, in Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_f2eob_cut14} we show (on the y-axis) the relative fraction of the component-mass-space region (with total-mass below $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$) over which the Taylor F2 waveform template bank has $\mathcal{FF}$ below or equal to the corresponding value on the x-axis. It was found that the $\FF$ of the Taylor F2 bank evaluated to be greater than or equal to $0.965 (0.947)$ at more than $99.9\%$ of the sampled points in this region. It is expected that systems with lower total mass can be detected using Taylor F2 banks, as lower total mass implies that the inspiral phase lasts longer in the sensitive frequency band of the detector. And as PN theory describes this phase of the evolution accurately, this decreases the relative importance of the missing merger-ringdown waveform cycles in the PN waveform. This is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:F2waveformsM}, which shows gravitational waveforms in the frequency domain, modeled using the Taylor F2 model. We see that as the total mass of the system decreases, it has more waveform cycles in the sensitive frequency band of the detector. 

In Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_f2eob}, we show a histogram of the fractional differences between the true physical mass parameters of a system and the mass parameters of the template waveform in the Taylor F2 bank that had the maximum value of maximized overlap with the EOBNRv2HM waveform for that system. In other words, it shows the fractional error in the mass parameters recovered using a bank of Taylor F2 waveform templates. The mass-coordinates used to show the errors are the dimensionless symmetric mass-ratio $\eta$, and the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Mchirpdef}
\mathcal{M}_c = (m_1m_2)^{3/5}(m_1+m_2)^{2/5}.
\end{equation}
The chirp mass parameter determines the total length in time of the inspiral part of the waveform (to leading order) \citep{SathyaBankPlacementTauN}, and the phase of the waveform is quite sensitive to it. This is also the reason why the chirp mass is recovered with greater precision, as seen in Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_f2eob_mchirp}. These figures serve the purpose of indicating that there are no accidental matches between the EOBNRv2HM and Taylor F2 waveforms with very different physical parameters, as the fractional difference between the actual physical parameters of the system and those recovered using the Taylor F2 template bank are $\lesssim 13\%$ for $\eta$ and $\lesssim 1\%$ for chirp mass which are not inconsistently large.

These results seem to indicate that, depending on one's tolerance for loss in the $\FF$ due to waveform model inaccuracy and coarseness of the discrete bank, 0.97$\MM$ Taylor F2 template banks can be used to search for BBH systems with total mass below $8.8M_{\odot}$ (for a tolerance of $10\%$ loss in the event observation rate) or $14M_{\odot}$ (for up to $15\%$ accepted loss)

\caption{\label{fig:cumhist_eobeob_all}This figure shows a cumulative histogram of the fraction of the component-mass region, where the bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms has $\mathcal{FF}^E$ less than the respective values on the x-axis. For example, over $0.1\%$ of the component-mass region, the EOBNRv2 bank has $\mathcal{FF}^E$ below the $0.97$. The component-mass region shown here has BBH systems with individual component-masses in $(3-25)M_{\odot}$.}
\end{figure} 
The 2PN Owen-Sathya metric \citep{SathyaMetric2PN} gives the mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ between two waveforms, if the source BBH of one of the waveforms has mass parameters \textit{slightly} different from the mass parameters of the source BBH of the other waveform, as defined in Eqn. [2.8] of Ref.\citep{SathyaMetric2PN}. Using this metric, one can place points in the component-mass space in a way that they are uniformly arranged in terms of the $\mathcal{M}$ between the waveforms for any neighboring points. Using this metric we can create a uniformly gridded (in $\mathcal{M}$) discrete bank of templates that is used for detection searches. These banks, built using 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms, were used in detection searches for initial LIGO data \citep{LSCSearch2004,LSCSearch2005,LSCSearch2008}. But the metric itself was derived using frequency domain Taylor F2 waveforms, accurate to 2PN order. Thus, \textit{a priori} one does not know if this metric will prove to be a good measure to use to generate template banks of EOBNRv2 waveforms. We will shed light on this issue in this section.

As in the previous section, we do a Monte-Carlo simulation over the entire stellar-mass BBH region. About 90,000 points were randomly sampled throughout the designated region of the component-mass space (uniformly distributed in individual component masses). For each point $a$, we calculate the maximum of maximized overlaps between the EOBNRv2 waveform at that point and the entire bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms, $\mathcal{FF}^E$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{FF}^E(a) = \underset{b}{\mathrm{max}}\,\Olap(h^{\X}_a,h^{\X}_b),
\end{equation}
where $b$ is any element of the discrete set of points in the component-mass space that constitutes the template bank, and $\X$ stands for $\textrm{EOBNRv2}$. As before, $h^{\X}_a$ denotes the waveform generated using approximant $\X$, for a BBH system whose component BHs have masses that are given by the coordinates of the point $a$. Since we use EOBNRv2 to model the true GW signals and also to model the templates, any departure of the $\FF$ from unity would solely be an artifact of the coarseness of the template bank grid. For a bank of template waveforms that was constructed with an intended $\FF$ of $0.97$ \citep{BabaketalBankPlacement,SathyaBankPlacementTauN}, we see in Fig.\ref{fig:match_eobeob_all} and Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_eobeob_all} that the $\mathcal{FF}^E$ of the bank remains above $0.97$ over ~98.5\% of the designated mass space. For no more than 1.5\% of the sample points, does the $\mathcal{FF}^E$ of the bank fall below 0.97. The least value of $\mathcal{FF}^E$ was found to be slightly above 0.96. 

From these results, its evident that the 2PN bank placement metric does well in covering the space adequately, with EOBNRv2 waveform templates. This metric was derived using the closed form frequency domain waveforms, accurate to 2PN, and we find here that it is also a good measure to use while placing template banks of EOB waveforms, that are accurate to pseudo-5PN. This result demonstrates that detection searches in aLIGO, which would use EOB waveform templates, can employ the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric to place template banks, without a significant drop in recovered SNR due to the coarseness of the bank grid.

%\subsection{TaylorT4}\label{sec:level2:EffectualnessTaylorT4}
%Fig.\ref{fig:match_t4eob_all} shows the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the Taylor T4 template bank at each point in the component-mass space. As with the Taylor F2 case, we observe a region of the component-mass space where the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the bank is above the acceptable minimum of $0.965$ \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008}. Looking in detail at the region of the space with total-masses below $12M_{\odot}$, we find that in this region, the Taylor T4 template bank has $\mathcal{FF}$ above $0.965$ over more than $99.9\%$ of the region. This is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_t4eob_cut12}, which shows the fraction of the component-mass region (with total mass below $12M_{\odot}$) where the T4 template bank has $\mathcal{FF}$ below the corresponding number on the x-axis. The histogram shows that, over no more than $0.02\%$ of the component-mass area does the $\mathcal{FF}$ of the T4 template bank drop below $0.965$.
%
%As before, in Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_t4eob}, we show a histogram of the fractional differences between the true physical parameters of a system and the parameters of the template in the Taylor T4 bank that has the maximum value of maximized overlap with the EOBNRv2HM waveform for that system.
%This illustrates that there are no accidental matches of the EOBNRv2HM and Taylor T4 waveforms with very different physical parameters, as the fractional difference between the actual physical parameters of the system and those recovered using the Taylor T4 template bank, which are $\lesssim 4\%$ for $\eta$ and $\lesssim 0.1\%$ for chirp mass, are within expected bounds [citation].

In the previous subsection we found that the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank placement metric is sufficiently accurate a measure to place a bank of EOBNRv2 waveform templates. Now we investigate the regions of the stellar-mass BBH component-mass space in which a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms can be used for detection searches. Following the previous subsections we do this by calculating the $\mathcal{FF}$ of a 0.97$\MM$ EOBNRv2 template bank throughout the designated mass-parameter space. As in Sec.\ref{sec:level2:EffectualnessTaylorF2}, we model the true GW signal with EOBNRv2HM waveforms. 

We do a Monte Carlo sampling of the component-mass space with 100,000 points, and for each point we generate the true GW signal using the EOBNRv2HM approximant. For each of these \textit{true} waveforms, we calculate the $\FF$ of the entire bank of EOBNRv2 waveform templates. Fig.\ref{fig:match_eob22eobhm_m1m2} and Fig.\ref{fig:match_eob22eobhm_mceta} show the value of the $\FF$ of the bank of EOBNRv2 waveform templates at all sample points over the designated component-mass region. Looking in detail at the region of the space with mass-ratio $q$ above $1.5 (3.25)$, we find that the $\FF$ of the EOBNRv2 waveform bank is above $0.965 (0.947)$ over $99.9\%$ of this restricted region. This is illustrated in the cumulative histograms shown in Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_eob22eobhm_cuteta23} which shows (on the y-axis) the fraction of the bank (with $q$ above $1.5 (3.25)$) that has $\FF$ below the corresponding number on the x-axis. 

For BBH systems with mass ratio $q$ quite close to unity, we have seen that the amplitude of the sub-leading waveform multipoles is orders of magnitude smaller than the amplitude of the dominant $(l=2,m=2)$ multipole. Thus, it is not surprising that we find that the $\FF$ of the EOBNRv2 bank falls below the threshold of $0.965$ BBH systems that are asymmetric in component-mass with $q\geq 1.5 (3.25)$.

Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_eob22eobhm} shows a histogram of the difference between the actual physical mass parameters of a system and the mass parameters of the EOBNRv2 template with which the waveform was recovered. This illustrates that there are no accidental matches of the EOBNRv2HM and EOBNRv2 waveforms with very different physical parameters, as the fractional difference between the actual physical parameters of the system and those recovered using the EOBNRv2 template bank, which are $\lesssim 6\%$ for $\eta$ and $\lesssim 1\%$ for chirp mass, are not inconsistently large. These results look promising in the sense that over a significant portion of the stellar-mass BBH space, the leading-order EOB waveform is quite sufficient to be used to detection purposes. The loss in recovered SNR, because of ignoring higher-order modes and the coarseness of the template bank, doesn't go above $10\%-15\%$ over a significant portion of the space.

Searches for GW signals from BBH systems involve matched-filtering the detector strain data with modeled waveforms templates as the filter. The efficiency of the filter hinges on the accuracy of the modeled waveform that is used as a filter template. In the past, 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms were used as templates in detection searches done over initial LIGO and Virgo data. With the increased sensitivity of the imminent second-generation detectors, the searches become even more sensitive to the inaccuracy of the template waveforms. 

Also, the detection searches are done with a discrete set of points, sampled over the component-mass space. Owen and Sathyaprakash \citep{OwenTemplateSpacing,SathyaMetric2PN,SathyaBankPlacementTauN} derived a metric in this space that lets one place a grid of points in it \citep{BabaketalBankPlacement}, given the requirement on the maximum allowed event observation rate loss due to the coarseness of the grid. The set of waveforms generated for systems corresponding to each of the points on this grid, is called a waveform template bank. A caveat in this method is that this metric was derived using frequency domain PN waveforms, which include corrections to the phase of the waveform to 2PN order, and \textit{a priori} need not be an accurate measure for placing a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms.

For stellar-mass BBH with individual black hole mass ranging in $(3-25)M_{\odot}$, detailed Monte-Carlo simulations show that template banks (constructed using the 2PN Owen-Sathya bank-placement metric \citep{SathyaMetric2PN}) of 3.5PN Taylor F2 waveforms can be used to search for gravitational waveforms  from BBH systems with total mass below $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$, without suffering more than a $10\% (15\%)$ loss in recovered SNR due to the template inaccuracy and a coarse bank grid. This was studied using the criterion of Fitting Factor ($\FF$) \citep{FittingFactorApostolatos}, and we computed the $\FF$ of the Taylor F2 template bank over the entire designated region of the component-mass space (Fig.\ref{fig:match_f2eob_all}). We found that a template bank of Taylor F2 waveforms has $\FF$ above $0.965 (0.947)$ for more than $99.9\%$ of the sampled points in the component-mass-space region with the total mass below $8.8M_{\odot} (14M_{\odot})$. This is expected, as the lower is the total mass of the BBH system, the more waveform cycles it has in the sensitive frequency band of the detector. The more the cycles that the waveform has in the sensitive band, the lesser the relative importance of the error due to the PN approximant lacking the part of the waveform corresponding to the merger-ringdown phase of the BBH dynamics.

We also study the effectiveness of the Owen-Sathya bank-placement metric in placing a bank of EOBNRv2 waveform templates. Again we perform large-scale Monte-Carlo investigations, calculating the $\FF$ of EOBNRv2 template bank against EOBNRv2 waveforms as the true GW signals. We find that a bank constructed with the requirement of $\MM$ to be 0.97, actually had $\FF$ above 0.97 for $98.5\%$ of the sampled points. The least value of the $\FF$ was found to be slightly above 0.96 for the same bank. Even though the metric was only constructed for 2PN accurate frequency domain PN waveforms, its success in sufficiently covering the component-mass space with EOBNRv2 waveforms is thus remarkable. This result is significant in the sense that it shows that while using EOB waveforms for detection searches in aLIGO, the 2PN Owen-Sathya metric is quite sufficient a measure to place a bank of waveform templates.

Finally, to determine the portion of the stellar-mass BBH space where EOBNRv2 template bank is sufficient for detection searches, we do the exact same study as we did for the Taylor F2 waveform template bank. We find that a template bank of EOBNRv2 waveforms can viably be used to search for GW signals from BBH systems with mass-ratio in the range $1\leq q\leq 1.5 (3.25)$ (Fig.\ref{fig:match_eob22eobhm_m1m2},\ref{fig:match_eob22eobhm_mceta}). We get to this threshold on $q$ with the requirement of maximum allowed loss in event observation rate (at a fixed SNR) due to higher-order EOB modes being ignored and the coarseness of the EOBNRv2 bank, to be $10\% (15\%)$. This is an expected result since binary systems with mass ratio close to unity, the gravitational waveform can be approximated by the leading order $(l=2,m=2)$ EOB waveform multipole . This is so because for such systems the sub-leading order waveform multipoles have amplitudes that are over an order of magnitude smaller than the amplitude of the leading waveform multipole. This is illustrated in Fig.(1) of Ref.\citep{BuonannoEOBv2Main}.

Our results suggest that a significant portion of the stellar-mass BBH systems can be searched for using existing iLIGO-style infrastructure. For systems with total mass below $8.8M_{\odot}-14M_{\odot}$ and q between unity and $1.25-3.25$, detection searches can use 0.97$\MM$ template banks of F2 and EOBNRv2 waveforms without more than a $10\%-15\%$ loss in event observation rate due to waveform inaccuracy and coarseness of the discrete bank grid. For BBH with total mass greater than $14M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $q> 3.25$, searching with template banks of either of Taylor F2 or EOBNRv2 will lead to higher than $15\%$ loss in detection rate due to these factors. So, to limit the event rate loss below that, GW signals from such BBH systems will need to be searched for using EOBNRv2HM waveforms. Work would be required in the future to be able to incorporate higher waveform modes into the detection searches \citep{HigherHarmonicsDAsearch}.

%\section{EOB: Gain in Search Volume}\label{sec:level1:SearchVolume}
%We compare the sensitivity of matched-filtering searches, in terms of the effective observation volume available to them, using the different waveform approximants described in the Sec.\ref{sec:level1:PNApproximants}. One can think of the effective observation volume as the (effective) spacial volume centered at the gravitational wave detector, within which, all binary systems emitting gravitational radiation will be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than $8$, by the matched-filter. In the advanced detector era, it is expected that we will be able to observe gravitational wave signals from stellar-mass binary-black-holes (with individual component-mass ranging in $(3-20)M_{\odot}$) upto distances of $\sim1GPc$ \citep{LSCCBCRates2010}. At such distances, we can take the distribution of the sources in the sky as isotropic and homogenous [citation]. With such a distribution of sources, the effective observation volume becomes a direct measure of the event observation rate.
%
%To elucidate what we are doing, lets start with the definition of the frequency weighted dot product (overlap) between two gravitational waveforms $h_1$ and $h_2$,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlap}
%(h_1|h_2) = 2\int^{\infty}_0\dfrac{\tilde{h}_1^*(f)\tilde{h}_2(f) + \tilde{h}_1(f)\tilde{h}_2^*(f)}{S_n(f)}\D f,
%\end{equation}
%where $S_n(f)$ is the Zero-Detuned-High-Power power spectral density estimate for advanced LIGO [citation], and $\tilde{h}(f) = \int^{\infty}_{-infty}exp(-2\pi\ii ft)h(t)\D t$ is the Fourier transform of the waveform $h(t)$. The factor of $S_n(f)$ gives more weight to the frequencies which advanced LIGO will be more sensitive  to, and lesser weight to the frequencies where its sensitivity would be less. This dot product (overlap), when normalized by the suitable norms of the two waveforms gives the normalized overlap between the two waveforms,
%\begin{equation}
%(\hat{h}_1|\hat{h}_2) = \dfrac{(h_1|h_2)}{\sqrt{(h_1|h_1)(h_2|h_2)}}.
%\end{equation}
%This normalized overlap would be sensitive to the relative phase of coalescence $\phi_c$ and time of coalescence $t_c$ between the two waveforms $h_1$ and $h_2$. These two parameters ($\phi_c$ and $t_c$) are extrinsic to the binary system that is the source of the gravitational waves, and so we maximize over them to get the maximized normalized overlap $\Olap$,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:maxnormolap}
%\Olap(h_1,h_2) = \underset{\phi_c,t_c}{max}\,\l(\hat{h}_1|\hat{h}_2(\phi_c,t_c)\r),
%\end{equation}
%that gives a measure of how close the two waveforms are in the waveform manifold. The mismatch $\mathrm{M}$ between the same two waveforms can hence be written as,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:mismatch}
%\mathrm{M}(h_1,h_2) = 1 - \Olap(h_1,h_2).
%\end{equation}
%\newline
%In a matched-filtering search, a segment of detector data $s(t)$, is matched with a template waveform $h(t)$ to give the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) $\rho$ as the output of the filter,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:SNR}
%\rho = \underset{\phi_c,t_c}{max} \dfrac{(s|h\l(\phi_c,t_c)\r)}{\sqrt{(h|h)}}.
%\end{equation}
%
%The gravitational wave signal produced from a coalescing black-hole-binary can be represented in the frequency domain as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:handg}
%\tilde{h}(f) \simeq D_{\eff}^{-1} e^{-2\pi\ii ft_0+2\ii\phi_0}\tilde{g}(f),
%\end{equation}
%where $D_{\eff}$ is the \textit{effective} distance that the detector perceives the binary to be located at; $t_0$ is the coalescence time of the binary (as measured by the detector); $\phi_0$ is a fiducial reference phase; and $\tilde{g}(f)$ is the waveform template that we use to matched-filter the detector data with. $\tilde{g}(f)$ depends only on the intrinsic parameters of the binary system (i.e. $m_1$ and $m_2$), and is normalised to unit effective distance. The effective distance is related to the actual physical distance $D_{\phys}$ at which the binary is located as [citation]
%\begin{equation}
%D_{\eff} = \dfrac{D_{\phys}}{\sqrt{F^2_+\l(1+\cos^2\iota\r)^2/4 + F^2_{\times}\cos^2\iota}},
%\end{equation}
%where $\iota$ is the angle between the line joining the detector to the binary, and the outward normal from the surface of the Earth, at the location of the detector (i.e. the inclination angle of the binary).
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%F_+ = \dfrac{1}{2}(1+\cos^2\theta)\cos2\Phi \cos2\Psi - \cos\theta \sin2\Phi \sin2\Psi ,\\
%F_+ = \dfrac{1}{2}(1+\cos^2\theta)\cos2\Phi \sin2\Psi + \cos\theta \sin2\Phi \cos2\Psi,
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%are the antenna patterns of the detector \citep{SathyaSchutzLRR} that give the sensitivity of the detector for different angular locations in the sky; and $\{\theta,\Phi,\Psi\}$ are the 3 Euler (sky) angles that are associated with the rotations that transform the frame in which the binary is in the x-y plane with its angular momentum pointing along the (+) z-axis; to the frame whose x and y axes rest along the detector's arms with the z-axis pointing outwards from the surface of the Earth.\newline
%The effective distance is a measured quantity that can be extracted from a matched-filtering search as [citation]
%\begin{equation}
%D_{\eff} = \dfrac{\sigma}{\rho};
%\end{equation}
%where $\sigma=\sqrt{(g|g)}$; and $\rho=(h|g)/\sqrt{(g|g)}$ is the SNR with which the signal $h$ will be detected using the waveform template $\tilde{g}(f)$. Note that this $\rho$ is the same as previously defined in Eq.\eqref{eq:SNR}. Systems located in the part of the sky with $\{\iota=0,\theta=0\}$ have $D_{\eff} = D_{\phys}$. Such systems are said to be \textit{optimally oriented}. For instance, an optimally oriented binary located at $D_{\phys}=D_0$ with $\{\iota=0,\theta=0,\Phi=0,\Psi=0\}$ will have an effective distance $D_{\eff} = D_{\phys}$, whereas the same binary located at the same physical distance, but with $\{\iota=\frac{\pi}{2},\theta=0,\Phi=0,\Psi=0\}$ will have $D_{\eff} = 2D_{\phys}$. In the latter orientation, the physical distance will have to be half of what it is required to be in the former orientation, for the gravitational radiation from the binary to be detected with the same SNR. In other words, in the latter orientation the obtained SNR will be half of the SNR obtained for the binary in the former orientation, keeping the physical distance the same across both cases.
%%An optimally oriented system is one that is located in the sky with an inclination angle $\iota$ with respect to the normal pointing out of the detector plane on the Earth is $0$ radians. The effective distance, we can find the actual physical distance at which the binary \textit{could} be located. Effective volume is the volume enclosed by the surface defined by the locus of the possible physical distances (which will have a spatial angular dependence) for a measured effective distance. By definition, all binaries within this spatial volume, will emit gravitaional radiation that will have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\geq 8$. We can find the radius of a sphere which has the same volume as the effective volume defined above, analytically, which will give us the effective observation volume.

%The furthest that a binary could be located, and be detectable with an SNR of $8$, is called the \textit{horizon distance} $D_{\horizon}$ [citation],
%\begin{equation}
%D_{\horizon}\equiv D_{\eff}(\rho = 8) = \dfrac{\sigma}{8}.
%\end{equation}
%The horizon distance defines a two-dimensional spacial surface (horizon) centered at the detector. The effective observation volume is the volume enclosed by this surface (horizon). By definition, all binaries within the effective observation volume, will emit gravitaional radiation that will have an SNR greater than $8$. Following Ref.\citep{FinnChernoffDA} we find the radius of a sphere which has the same volume as the effective volume defined above enclosed within the horizon at SNR $8$. This is ovservation volume that we measure corresponding to the usage of different waveform approximants to model the template waveforms.\newline
%Making the assumption that the full IMR EOB model models the nature's waveforms almost perfectly \citep{EOBNRdevel01}, we calculate the horizon distance for a matched-filtering search done with IMR EOB template waveforms as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:DhorizonEOB}
%D^{\EOB}_{\horizon} = \dfrac{\sigma^{\EOB}}{8} = \dfrac{\sqrt{(g^{\EOB}|g^{\EOB})}}{8},
%\end{equation}
%where $g^{\EOB}$ has the same meaning as in Eqn.\eqref{eq:handg} if $\tilde{h}(f)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain EOB waveform $h^{\EOB}(t)$. For other approximants, the horizon distance to which a match filtering search can detect using that approximant is the horizon distance the same search could detect to with the exact waveforms (approximated with IMR EOB waveforms), scaled by the fractional loss in signal-to-noise ratio due to the inherent inaccuracy of the approximant. For high SNR, the fractional loss in SNR because of the inherent inaccuracy of the waveform approximant used, is approximated by the mismatch between the waveform generated using the particular approximant and the IMR EOB waveform (for the same binary system). So, the horizon distance to which matched-filtering searches can detect gravitational wave signals to using the waveform approximant $\X$ is
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:DeffPN}
%D^{\X}_{\horizon} = D^{\EOB}_{\horizon}\times\Olap(h^{\X},h^{\EOB}),
%\end{equation}
%where $\X$ could be the Taylor T3 or the Taylor T4 or the Taylor F2 approximant of just the IM EOB waveforms; and $h^{\X}$ is the waveform generated using approximant $\X$.
%%
%%Now, to get the effective observation volume for approximant $\X$, we need to find the radius $R_{\eff}$ of the sphere, whose volume equals the volume of space that encapsulates all sources that will be detectable with $\rho\geq 8$. Ref.\citep{FinnChernoffDA} calculates this to be (Eq.(5.1,5.2)):
%%\begin{equation}
%%\begin{split}
%%R_{\eff} = & r_0 \left[3\int_0^{\infty}\D x\,x^2 P(\rho^2(x)\geq\rho_0^2) \right]^{1/3}\\
%%\equiv & r_0 \left[3\int_0^{\infty}\D x\,x^2 P(\Gamma\geq x^2) \right]^{1/3}
%%\end{split}
%%\end{equation}
%%where $x$ is the radial parameter of the effective sphere divided by $r_0$, and $r_0$ is a fiducial distance defined in Eq.(5.2a) of Ref.\citep{FinnChernoffDA};
%%\begin{subequations}
%%\begin{align}\nonumber
%%r_0 \equiv & \l(\dfrac{5M^{5/3}\eta f_{7/3}}{96\pi^{4/3}\rho_0^2} \r)^{1/2},\\
%%f_{7/3} = &  \int_0^{\infty}\D f \left[f^{7/3} S_n(f) \right]^{-1},\\
%%\Gamma = & 16\left[F^2_+\l(1+cos^2\iota\r)/4 + F^2_{\times}cos^2\iota \right],
%%\end{align}
%%\end{subequations}
%%where $f_{7/3} $ is the moment of the power spectral density $S_n(f)$ of the noise in the detector; and $\Gamma$ depends on the antenna patterns of the detector and the inclination angle of the binary, and lies in the range $[0,16]$. Now, if all the sources were optimally oriented, $\Gamma = 16$ always, and $R_{\eff} (\equiv R_{\eff}^{\opt})$ for such a distribution would trivially be equal to $D_{\horizon}$.
%%\begin{equation}
%%\begin{split}
%%R^{\opt}_{\eff} = & r_0 \left[3\int_0^{\infty}\D x x^2 P(\Gamma > x^2) \right]^{1/3},\\
%%= & r_0 \left[3\int_0^{4}\D x x^2 \right]^{1/3},\\ 
%%= & 4 r_0.

%%V_{\eff} = \dfrac{4\pi}{3} R^3_{\eff},
%%\end{equation}
%%where
%%\begin{equation}
%%\begin{split}
%%R_{\eff} \equiv & R^{\iso}_{\eff},\\ 
%%= & \dfrac{(3\times 1.84)^{1/3}}{4} R^{\opt}_{\eff},\\
%%\approx & \dfrac{1}{2.26} R^{\opt}_{\eff} = \dfrac{1}{2.26} D_{\horizon}.
%%\end{split}
%%\end{equation}
%The effective observation volume available to a matched-filtering search using waveform approximant $\X$,
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%V^{\X}_{\eff} &= \dfrac{4\pi}{3} \l(\dfrac{D^{\X}_{\horizon}}{2.26}\r)^3,\\
%					&= \dfrac{4\pi}{3} \l(\dfrac{D^{\EOB}_{\horizon}}{2.26}\times\Olap(h^{\X},h^{\EOB})\r)^3;
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%for a spatially homogenous and isotropic distribution of sources in the universe, where the factor of 2.26 comes from Ref.\citep{FinnChernoffDA}.
%
%Fig.\ref{fig:VeffsLog} shows the variation of the effective observation volume with total mass of the source binary, corresponding to the use of each of the waveform approximants, for certain values of mass-ratio $q(=m_1/m_2)\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. As we are interested in stellar-mass binary-black-holes, we restrict the individual component masses in the range $(3-20)M_{\odot}$. As a general trend, we observe that the loss in effective observation volume increases with the total mass of the system. For systems more massive than $\sim20M_{\odot}$, all the PN approximants have visibly lower observation volume, as compared to the use of EOB waveforms. 
%Table\ref{tab:maxTotalMassVeff} lists the maximum value of the total mass of the system, for each of the PN approximant, for which the loss in the effective observation volume is no more than $10\%$, as compared to EOB waveforms. For example, using Taylor F2 approximant in a matched-filtering search for equal-mass systems, leads to a loss in the effective observation volume for those signals of no more than $10\%$ for systems with total mass up to $16M_{\odot}$. For mass-ratio $q\geq 3$, we observe that using both Taylor T4 and Taylor T3 approximants lead to visibly large reduction in the effective observation volume. Also, Taylor F2 approximant can be used to matched-filter signals from binary systems with total mass below $\sim 18M_{\odot}$, with less than $10\%$ loss in effective observation volume, and hence the event rate. Taylor T3 approximant has a higher than $10\%$ loss in effective observation volume, across almost the entire designated component-mass range. For systems with total mass above $\sim18M_{\odot}$, none of the PN approximants can be viably utilized in a matched-filtering search.
%
%This indicates that there is a preferential area in the component-mass space, where the computationally inexpensive PN approximants (like Taylor F2) can be used in a matched-filtering search. There is also the remaining part of the same space which can only be searched viably using IMR EOB waveforms.
%%Similar to Fig.\ref{fig:Olaps}, in the effective observation volume numbers, we observe very small numerical fluctuations. The cause of these is the same as described in Sec.\ref{sec:level2:PNComparison}, and just like in Fig.\ref{fig:Olaps}, the variance of these fluctuations are plotted as errorbars in Fig.\ref{fig:VeffsLog}. Also, the strange behaviour of the T4 waveforms for more asymmetric systems, is also carried over to these figures, and have the same cause as described in Sec.\ref{sec:level2:PNComparison}.

%Following the previous section, in this section we investigate in detail the region in the component-mass space where it suffices to use the PN approximants (Taylor F2 and T4) for matched-filtering detection searches, and where using EOB is clearly more viable. In this section, we address this question for searches that use a discrete \textit{bank} \citep{SathyaBankPlacementTauN,SathyaMetric2PN} of waveform templates, as were used in earlier searches done over the intial LIGO data \citep{LSCSearch2004,LSCSearch2005,LSCSearch2008}. As before, the region of the component-mass space that we study is the stellar-mass binary-black-hole region with individual component mass lying in $(3-20)M_{\odot}$.
%
%We do a Monte-Carlo simulation over the entire stellar-mass binary-black-hole mass region. The simulation was done by generating 100,000 points over the designated region of the component-mass space, uniformly distributed in individual component-mass. We take each of these points, and generate the full IMR EOB waveform for the system with component masses given by the coordinates of the point $a$, starting from the time when the gravitational-wave frequency from the system crosses 15Hz, and ending when the quasi-normal ringing of the final black-hole (formed by the coalescence of the binary) stops. Let $a$ represent a representative point and $h_a^{\EOB}$ be the EOB waveform (shown in superscript) for the point $a$ (shown in the subscript). We also generate a bank of template waveforms of approximant $\X$, using the Owen-Sathya bank placement metric \citep{OwenTemplateSpacing,SathyaBankPlacementTauN,SathyaMetric2PN} to cover the same mass region, with the requirement that the waveform generated for \textit{any} point $a$ in that mass-region will have a maximized overlap $\geq 0.97$ with \textit{at least} one point in the bank; i.e. $\Olap(h^{\X}_a,h^{\X}_b)\geq 0.97$ for at least one point $h^{\X}_b$ in the aforementioned bank of template waveforms . This is equivalent to saying that the bank has a \textit{minimal match} $\mathrm{MM}$ of $0.97$. Here, $\X$ could be either the Taylor F2 or Taylor T4 waveform approximant.
%
%Given a point $a$ in the component-mass space, and the exact waveform $h^e_a$ generated using the coordinates of the point $a$ as component-masses; the \textit{effectualness} of a bank of template waveforms (of approximant $\X$) is defined as the maximum value of maximized overlap between $h^e_a$ and any member $h^{\X}_b$ of the template waveform bank, i.e.
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{E}(h^e_a|h^{\X}) = \underset{b}{max}\dfrac{(h^e_a|h^{\X}_b)}{\sqrt{(h^e_a|h^e_a)(h^{\X}_b|h^{\X}_b)}}.
%\end{equation}
%When searching for signals in detector data, the data is matched-filtered through the entire bank of waveform templates and the maximum value of the SNR over the entire bank is used in further statistical analysis \citep{LSCSearch2004,LSCSearch2005,LSCSearch2008}. Thus, for a detection search that aims at less than $10\%$ loss in event detection rate, what is required is a bank of template waveforms that has effectualness above $0.965$ over the entire component-mass region that it covers \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008,CompTemplates2009}.
%
%In the Monte-Carlo simulation over the bank, for every point $a$ we approximate the exact $h^e_a$ with $h^{\EOB}_a$ \citep{EOBNRdevel01}, and calculate the effectualness of the template bank (generated for different waveform approximants) at each of the sample points distributed across the component-mass space.
%
%\subsection{TaylorF2}\label{sec:level2:EffectualnessTaylorF2}
%Fig.\ref{fig:match_f2eob_all} shows the effectualness of the Taylor F2 template bank at each point in the component-mass space. We observe a region of the component-mass space where the effectualness of the bank is high enough to not have an event detection rate loss above $10\%$, which corresponds to a minimal effectualness of $0.965$ \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008}. Looking in detail at the region of the space with total-masses below $14M_{\odot}$, we see that in this region of the component-mass space, the bank of Taylor F2 waveform templates has effectualness greater than $0.965$ throughout. This is illustrated by the histogram in Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_f2eob_cut14}. This cumulative histogram shows the relative fraction of the component-mass-space region (with total mass below $14M_{\odot}$) over which the Taylor F2 waveform template bank has an effectualness below or equal to the value on the x-axis. As can be seen, the Taylor F2 bank has, at all the points sampled in this region, effectualness above $0.965$. This corresponds to a maximum loss in event rate of $10\%$ \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008}.
%
%Also, in Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_f2eob}, we can see a histogram of the fractional differences between the true physical mass parameters of a system and the mass parameters of the template waveform in the Taylor F2 bank that has the maximum value of maximized overlap with the IMR EOB waveform for that system. In other words, it shows the fractional error in the mass parameters recovered using a bank of F2 waveform templates. The mass-coordinates we show the errors in are the dimensionless symmetric mass-ratio $\eta$, and the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c$,
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{M}_c = M \eta^{3/5}.
%\end{equation}
%This chirp mass parameter determines the total length in time of the inspiral part of the waveform (to leading order) \citep{SathyaBankPlacementTauN}, and it contains more information than the component-mass parameters. This is also the reason why the chirp mass is recovered with greater precision, as seen in Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_f2eob}. This illustrates that there are no accidental matches of the IMR EOB and Taylor F2 waveforms with very different physical parameters, as the fractional difference between the actual physical parameters of the system and those recovered using the Taylor F2 template bank are $\lesssim 6\%$ for $\eta$ and $\lesssim 0.15\%$ for chirp mass, which are within the expected range [citation].
%
%\subsection{TaylorT4}\label{sec:level2:EffectualnessTaylorT4}
%Fig.\ref{fig:match_t4eob_all} shows the effectualness of the Taylor T4 template bank at each point in the component-mass space. As with the Taylor F2 case, we observe a region of the component-mass space where the effectualness of the bank is above the acceptable minimum of $0.965$ \citep{WaveformAccuracy2008}. We found, looking in detail at the region of the space with total-masses below $12M_{\odot}$, that in this region of the component-mass space, the Taylor T4 template bank has effectualness above $0.965$ over more than $99.9\%$ of the region. This is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:cumhist_t4eob_cut12}, which shows the fraction of the component-mass region (with total mass below $12M_{\odot}$) where the T4 template bank has an effectualness below the corresponding number on the x-axis. The histogram shows that, over no more than $0.02\%$ of the component-mass area does the effectualness of the T4 template bank drop below $0.965$.
%
%As before, in Fig.\ref{fig:errparams_t4eob}, we show a histogram of the fractional differences between the true physical parameters of a system and the parameters of the template in the Taylor T4 bank that has the maximum value of maximized overlap with the IMR EOB waveform for that system.
%This illustrates that there are no accidental matches of the IMR EOB and Taylor T4 waveforms with very different physical parameters, as the fractional difference between the actual physical parameters of the system and those recovered using the Taylor F2 template bank, which are $\lesssim 4\%$ for $\eta$ and $\lesssim 0.1\%$ for chirp mass, are within expected bounds [citation].
