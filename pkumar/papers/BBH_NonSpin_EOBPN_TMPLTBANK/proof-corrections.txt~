We have 6 minor corrections, which are

--1) Change one author in reference [51]: H. D. Pfeiffer --> H. P. Pfeiffer
--2) For reference, [35], the author is "David Shoemaker", for the "LIGO Collaboration".
--3) Replace "BH" with "black hole" (page 4)
--4) To make it clear for readers of the b/w print, change the caption of Fig. 4, to put the second word "blue" in brackets, i.e. "(blue)", as in

"The blue curve shows the ... in the subregion."

to 

"The (blue) curve shows the ... in the subregion.".

--5) Change all occurances of "an MM" to "a MM".
--6) Insert a space in the last line of Sec. IIB, by changing ".. (semi)analytic form .." to ".. (semi) analytic form ..".

As regarding the figures, we think that the color-bars in Fig. 1,3,5,6,7 should be clear in black and white print as well.

Apart from these points, the proof looks good; and with these changes, please proceed with its further processing.

--1) page 3, 4th last line, "Eqs. [38a-19b]"-->"Eqs. [38a-39b]"
--2) Sec.IIB, the very first line, "The frequency-weighted overlap.." --> "The noise-weighted overlap.."
--3) Sec.III, last line before the beginning of Sec.IIIA, there is an intersection symbol $\cap$ that needs to be a union symbol $\cup$, i.e.
"We can give the parameter sets $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ different elements than the ones shown here, i.e. $\theta_1 \neq \{m_1,m_2\}, \theta_2 \neq \{\iota,\theta,\phi,\psi\}, \theta_1 \cap \theta_2 = \{m_1,m_2,\iota,\theta,\phi,\psi\}$, in order to obtain more information about another set of parameters $\theta_1'$." ==>
