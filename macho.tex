\section{Gravitational Microlensing}

\section{Gravitational Waves Binary Black Hole MACHOs}

Motivation for search: dark matter problem in the galaxy, microlensing
results, Nakamura proposal that MACHOs may be (B)BHs. Predicted rate is
$5\times10^{-2}\times2^{\pm 1}$ events/yr/galaxy is higher than BNS rate.
Waveforms well modelled, same pipeline as S2 BNS. Brief description of sciruns
with reference to instument paper and S2 BNS paper.

\section{Binary Black Hole MACHO Population Models}

Review Ioka et al paper on BBH formation in the early universe. Density of
local dark matter. Review population models used and make some plots of MACHO
distribution.
