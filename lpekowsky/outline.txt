1. Introduction


2. Theory of gw -> effect -> detectors
   
   a. Theory (Derivation of the wave equation, effect on freely-
      falling particles)
   b. Detection with interferometers (introduce data quality in this
      section)

3. Source modelling and Detchar Sources

    a. Quadrapole formula
    b. Post-Newtonian approximations (Taylor, EOB)
    c. Numerical Relativity (3+1 decomposition, pseudo-spectral
       methods (?), generalized harmonic)
    d. Hybrids


4. Searches
   a. Matched filter, maximization over chirplen, PSD

   b. Layout of the bank (High/Low) (should I talk about why it's wrong?)

   c. Data conditioning (PSD estimation, inverse spectrum truncation)

   d. chisq test

   e. Clustering?


5. Boyle et. al.

6. Intro + copy/paste NINJA1 + outro

7. NINJA 2  (maybe combine with 6)
   a. Where to switch over to EOB?

8. Characterization of a GW detector
   a. The segment database and utilities (high level overview)

   b. Daily ihope (detailed description of the pipeline, walk-
      through of pages)

   c. Application to front-end code checks

   d. Application to single-detector FARs for the Dog


9. Open questions for GW detection
   a. Bank metric
   b. Penguins
   c. sarlacc
