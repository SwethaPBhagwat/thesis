\Abstract{
Gravitational waves are a consequence of the general theory of
relativity.  Direct detection of such waves will provide a wealth of
information about physics, astronomy, and cosmology.  A worldwide
effort is currently underway to make the first  direct detection of
gravitational waves.  The global network of detectors includes the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which
recently completed its sixth science run.

A particularly promising source of gravitational waves is a binary
system consisting of two neutron stars and/or black holes.  As the
objects orbit each other they emit gravitational radiation, lose
energy, and spiral inwards.  This produces a characteristic ``chirp''
signal for which we can search in the LIGO data.  Currently this is
done using matched-filter techniques, which correlates the detector
data against analytic models of the emitted gravitational waves.
Several choices must be made in searching for for signals from such
binary coalescences. 

Any discrepancy between the signals and the models used will reduce
the effectiveness of the matched filter.  However, the analytic models
are based on approximations which are not valid through the entire
evolution of the binary.  In recent years numerical relativity has had
impressive success in simulating the final phases of the coalescence
of binary black holes.  While numerical relativity is too
computational expensive to use directly in the search, this progress
has made it possible to perform realistic tests of the LIGO searches.
The results of such tests can be used to improve the efficiency of
searches.

Conversely, noise in the LIGO and Virgo instruments can reduce the
efficiency.  This must be addressed by characterizing the quality of
the data from the detectors, and removing from the analysis times that
will be detrimental to the search.

In this thesis we utilize recent results from numerical relativity to
study both the degree to which analytic models match realistic
waveforms and the ability of LIGO searches to make detections.  We
also apply the matched-filter search to the problem of removing times
of excess of noise from the search.

\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}

I have been fortunate to work with a large number of people through my
membership in the LIGO and NINJA collaborations.  Sadly space makes it
impossible to thank them all individually, and I hope the vast
majority I must omit will forgive me.

I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown.  I
have benefited immensely from Duncan's vast knowledge of and passion
for gravitational-wave astronomy.  I could not have asked for a better
mentor, nor did I ever expect to find one with whom I could share so
many laughs.

I would also like to thank Andrew Lundgren, with whom I worked on
detchar.  Andy was great fun to work with, and his brilliance is
matched only by his passion for squashing glitches in the detectors.
Much of this work was also done with Josh Smith, to whom I am also
grateful.

I am indebted to the other members of the Syracuse University
gravitational-wave faculty, Peter Saulson and Stefan Ballmer for their
many excellent questions and suggestions regarding my work, and clear
and detailed explanations of their own.

The NINJA project has introduced me to a great many numerical
relativists from whom I have learned a great deal.  I would like
especially to thank Mike Boyle, with whom I worked on the studies in
chapter~\ref{ch:comparison}, Harald Pfeiffer, and Deirdre Shoemaker.

On the data-analysis side of NINJA, I would like to thank Satya
Mohapatra for his help in testing the data sets and numerous other
contributions as well as many fascinating conversations at
conferences.

It has been a joy to share an office with Collin Capano, Justin
Garofoli, and Matt West, and I would like to thank them for their
innumerable assistance and physics bull sessions.

I would also like to thank Ping Wei, with whom I worked on the segment
database, and Peter Couvares for all his help with Condor and friendly
chat about computer science and other things.

None of this would have been possible without the love and support of
my parents, to whom I am eternally grateful.  Finally, my thanks to my
long-time friends, known collectively as "the canetoads" for their
words of encouragement and all the good times.


\prefacesection{Conventions}

We adopt the Einstein summation convention where repeated indices are
summed over.  Parenthesis are shorthand for the fully symmetric sum
%
\begin{equation*}
A_{(\alpha\beta)}
= \frac{1}{2} \left(A_{\alpha\beta} 
+ A_{\beta\alpha} \right)
\end{equation*}
%
and square brackets are fully antisymmetric
%
\begin{equation*}
A_{[\alpha\beta]}
= \frac{1}{2} \left(A_{\alpha\beta} 
- A_{\beta\alpha} \right)
\end{equation*}
%
We take the signature of spacetime to be $(-1,+1,+1,+1)$.

Except where otherwise noted we work in geometric units where
$G=c=1$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

We define the Fourier transform of a function of time $g(t)$ to be
$\tilde{g}(f)$, where
%
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{g}(f)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t)\, e^{- 2 \pi i f t}\, dt
\end{equation*}
%
and the inverse Fourier transform is
%
\begin{equation*}
g(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(f)\, e^{2 \pi i f t}\, dt
\end{equation*}
%
This convention differs from that used in some gravitational-wave
literature, but is the adopted convention in the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration.

\noindent The time-stamps of interferometer data are measured in
Global Positioning System (GPS) seconds: seconds since 00:00.00 UTC
January 6, 1980 as measured by an atomic clock.
