\section{The Bank Metric}

Plots of the standard low-mass banks with (2.0, 3.5, 4.0?) templates
and waveforms

Note the 3.5 PN bank is in development (Cite Owen, ??, Pekowsky in
preparation)

Note SVD and related work may make this less important in the future.


\section{Selecting Triggers from the SNR and $\chi^2$ Time Series}

AKA the penguins

max over chirplen

ringing off inverse spectrum truncation

Note that coincidence seems to cure most of this


\section{Loss of SNR Due to Loud Glitches}

Can I derive bias in a median estimator when a highly improbable
outlier is added?

plot of SNR recovered from a T4 injection at the end of a 2048-second
block as a function of glitch magnitude at the beginning
