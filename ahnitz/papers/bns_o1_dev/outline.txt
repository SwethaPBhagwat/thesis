Improvements to the Pipeline for O1 

* Overall Results -> sensitivity improvement from tuning changes to BNS pipeline
    * (new features) improved background estimation 
        * many time slides
        * two far measures 
        * include injections in timeslides

    * tuning: 
        * psd tuning 
        * lower frequency cutoff (show power distribution plots)
            * present argument for linear template duration increase
        * coincidence window
        * chisq bin tuning (implementation of chisq for large bins??)
        * SNR threshold with two-detectors (limit of background estimation) 
        * robusteness of tuning to different data types
              * S6, recolored S6, s5

    * template bank choice tradeoff 
        * increase in False alarms for different bank choices
