This paper presents the first description of a metric and placement algorithm
for constructing a template bank effictive for searching for gravitational
waves from binary systems with aligned spin.  Prior methods of constructing
template metrics (e.g. Owen, and Owen and Sathyaprakash) only considered
non-spinning waveforms up to 2PN order.

Our method of constructing a metric for 3.5pN binary systems with the leading
order spin and spin-orbit terms, orthonormalizing the parameter space, and
rotating to the space of the principal components is novel. We have attempted
to edit the text to make this point clearer.

We thank the referee for pointing this out; we agree that the current text is
unclear that our method is novel, as well as the implementation and results of
the tests.

In the abstract we have noted that:

"We present a new method for constructing template banks for gravitational
wave searches for systems with spin. We present a new metric in a parameter
space in which the template placement metric is globally flat."

In the introduction, we have added a new paragraph:

"We present a new geometric algorithm for placing templates for BNS systems
with spin, which has a significantly higher sensitivity than previous
searches.  Our new algorithm constructs a metric on the parameter space using
the various coefficients of the TaylorF2 expansion of the orbital phase as
coordinates. In such a coordinate system the parameter space metric is
globally flat, therefore we can transform into a Euclidean coordinate system.
Finally, our method uses a Principal Coordinate Analysis to identify a two
dimensional manifold that can be used to cover the aligned spin BNS parameter
space using existing two dimensional lattice placement algorithms."

We do note that a work by Pai and Arun also used SVD on the Fisher matrix to
derive 8 terms which express the non-spinning PN phasing for binaries.  This
work was conducted simultaneously and independently to this ours, and does not
address spin, nor apply the method to template placement.

None of the work in this paper rests on the results of the works listed as
"in preperation." Based on the referee's concerns, and to clarify this issue,
we have deleted the references to [44] and [51] the results of which are not
used in our work. We have also corrected Ref. [41] (the reference to the
SpinTaylor T4 waveform) to refer to Buonnano, Chen and Vallisneri, with an
additional reference that the implementation used here comes from the LSC
Algorithm Library.

The same procedure can definitely be applied and a bank generated including
the sub-dominant spin corrections.  At the refree's suggestion we have
investigated whether the inclusion if these terms changes our result.  We have
added a paragraph and a new plot at the end of section III where we
demonstrate that the effect of including the known, higher order spin terms is
small.  The relevant text changes are as follows:

The comment before the PN equations now reads:

"Other spin-related corrections to the PN phasing have been computed
\cite{Mikoczi:2005dn,Arun:2008kb}, however, in this work we mainly restrict to
only the two dominant terms. The methods described here are easily extendable
to include additional spin correction terms and this does not significantly
change our results, as we demonstrate at the end of this section."

and the new paragraph reads:

"Finally, we wish to investigate the effect that the higher order spin
contributions to the orbital phase have on our method. To do this we repeat
the process described above, but include the spin(1)-spin(1) and
spin(2)-spin(2) contributions to the $\sigma$ term at 2PN order and also the
2.5PN spin-orbit term as given in \cite{Arun:2008kb}. In Figure
\ref{fig:higher_order_spin} we plot $\xi_1$ against $\xi_2$ when these higher
order spin terms are included, the color shows the mismatch between the center
and edges in the $\xi_3$ direction. This plot can be directly compared to
Figure \ref{fig:param_space_mismatch}.  By comparing these plots we can see
that including the higher order spin terms has caused the parameter space to
become larger in the $\xi_2$ direction. However, the depth of the space in the
$\xi_3$ direction has reduced by almost an order of magnitude. In this case
the stacking process is not required and the resulting bank consists of
$\sim560000$ templates. "

We feel that these equations are necessary; without the explicit equations in
the text it may not be clear what our coordinates actually are. Even though we
acknowledge that these equations are not new, we feel that the paper is not
self contained if we omit them. We will check these carefully in the proofs.

This statement has been edited to remove the ambiguity that the referee
reports. It now reads as follows.

"This metric is used to approximate the mismatch in the neighborhood
of any point. When doing this care must be taken to choose a ``good'' set
of coordinates where extrinsic curvature is minimized. If a ``bad'' set of
coordinates is chosen, the region in which this approximation can be used will
be very small. To minimize this issue when placing the two-dimensional
non-spinning bank, the masses $m_1, m_2$ are transformed into the ``chirp
times'' $\tau_0, \tau_3$~\cite{OwenSathyaprakash98}."

> - Above (19): Eq. (18) is a definition, so how can it be "solved"?

We have edited this sentence to read: "As shown in \cite{Owen96} it is possible to evaluate the derivative in (\ref{eq:cbc_metric}), maximizing over the phase, $\phi_C$, to give the metric in terms of a 9 dimensional space:"

The figures have been lightened as suggested.
