This paper compares families of post-Newtonian waveforms for the
inspiral of compact objects, in the regime where one object is a
neutron star and the other a black hole, which can be spinning. This
work is an important contribution to our understanding of these
waveforms for gravitational-wave searches, and I recommend
publication. However, the authors focus on the direct agreement
between the waveforms (their faithfulness), and devote very little
time to measures of how they would perform in a search (fitting
factors). This paper will be a far more significant contribution to
the field if this imbalance is addressed. Suggestions along these
lines form the substantive part of my comments below.

As I understand it, the main conclusion of the paper is that, for NSBH
systems, current PN approximants do not agree well for many systems
where the black hole is spinning. This is in contrast to nonspinning
cases, which were studied in detail in Ref. 13. The difference is that
Ref. 13 looked at the effectualness of the approximants, which is a
measure of how well they will perform in a search.

It is clear from the results in the paper that the spinning PN
approximants are not in as good agreement as the nonspinning
approximants, and this is an important point to make, and is made very
clearly and thoroughly. But the implications for GW searches are not
so clear.

Only one figure in this paper, Fig. 13, shows the fitting factor
between two approximants. The third to last paragraph of the
introduction refers to Figs 2-6 as the key results of the paper, but
is it not Fig 13 that is the key result? I suggest that the authors
put more emphasis on this result, and discuss it in more detail. For
example, over what range of masses and spins were the matches
optimized? If only physically allowable spin values were used, then it
is reasonable to expect that the optimized match would be lower for
those signals at the edge of the parameter space. If larger spins are
allowed, how does the figure change? This has implications for
parameter bias, but it would be instructive to see those results, and
draw conclusions accordingly.

The paper should also include a similar figure that uses the latest PN
spin terms. This is done for the faithfulness in Figs. 2 and 3, and,
although the authors downplay the improvement from Fig. 2 to Fig. 3,
it looks significant to me, and suggests that fitting factors using
these updated approximants may be far better than what is currently
shown in Fig. 13.

Finally, Ref. 13 concludes that inspiral-only approximants are
acceptable for searches only for systems with a total mass less than
around 12 solar masses. For NSBH systems, this implies mass ratios
less than 8. This paper shows results up to mass ratios of 15. The
authors should explain why the faithfulness of the PN approximants is
of interest at mass ratios where these approximants would not be
considered acceptable for a search even in nonspinning cases.

Some minor comments:

- The abstract states that higher order PN spin corrections will
complicate searches. I assume the authors mean something different
here. Once higher order terms are known, they can be simply added to
current search codes.

- Page 2, paragraph 3. The sentence that cites Ref. 34 says,
"convergence is not gauranteed in this regime". My understanding was
that it is not gauranteed in any regime that is relevant to compact
binary searches.

- Again, at the end of the first paragraph on page 6, the authors
refer to a PN expansion that "has not yet sufficiently converged",
suggesting that sometimes it *has* converged.

- A 0.97 contour line on Fig. 13 would help in its interpretation
