We thank the referee for their thoughtful review of our paper and for their
valuable suggestions and comments. We have addressed their comments and have
made changes that are detailed below.

We focus this paper on investigating the accuracy of the waveforms themselves. 
While fitting factors and overlaps are both useful in understanding the
impact of different waveform approximants, faithfulness is able elucidate 
issues in waveforms that are hidden by maximizing over a 
range of parameters. This paper is focused on highlighting these issues and
demonstrating where improvement is desired. This motivates the derivation and 
use of higher order post-Newtonian spin corrections and further investigation into the 
parameter estimation biases.

We agree that understanding the effect on search performance is very important. 
To more fully understand the impact on search efficiency, it is important to introduce 
astrophysically motivated populations of sources and examine the 
fraction of recovered signals. For these systems the effect 
of precession is significant and so should be taken into account. 
In a companion paper, we thoroughly cover these issues, along with the
construction of aligned spin NSBH template banks (arXiv:1307.3562).

We agree. These results are included in a new plot (Fig. 14), similar to Fig. 13, 
that shows the fitting factors using the updated approximants. The plot shows a 
substantial improvement for systems with aligned spins, but none for 
anti-aligned systems.

While Fig. 13 and 14 are important, they are not the key results. While they
are indicative of particular sources of signal loss, they do neglect precession
effects. This is handled in detail in our companion paper.

This is a very valid point, we have expanded the discussion of the template bank
used to read as follows.

"The fitting factor maximizes the match between a signal and a bank of 
templates designed to capture e.g. $97\%$ of the optimal signal-to-noise ratio.
The template bank is constructed to be valid for the same range of masses
and spins used throughout this paper and detailed in Sec~\ref{sec:introduction}.
Discrepancies in match due to differing approximants may be compensated 
for by allowing a waveform to match to a template with shifted parameters."

The chosen distribution has been moved to a more prominant location in the 
introduction and reads as follows.

"In this paper, we consider \ac{NSBH} binaries with the \ac{NS} mass between 1
and $3\, M_\odot$, the \ac{BH} mass between $3$ and $15\, M_\odot$, the
\ac{NS} spin between 0 and $0.05$ and the
\ac{BH} spin between 0 and 1.
"

We do restrict to maximizing over only physical mass and spin parameters. 
While it is possible that expanding the template bank may improve the
fitting factors for particular systems, the result is a larger template bank,
and a possible increase in the false alarm rate. In addition, there is no guarantee
that the true gravitational waveforms of astrophysical sources 
would lie in this extended parameter space.

We agree that the merger and ringdown are important, however, even at
highest total mass that we consider (18), the vast majority
of signal power originates from the inspiral. We use a broad range of mass ratios
to demonstrate where the approximants are not acceptable.

To address this we have added the following to the introduction.

"Even at the upper range of masses we consider, $(3+15)M_{\odot}$, 
it has been shown in the case of numerically modelled binary
black hole waveforms that inspiral-only template banks recover $> 95\%$ of the signal
power~\cite{Brown:2012nn,Smith:2013mfa}.

>Some minor comments.

Thank you for pointing this out. It was certainly not our intent to say 
that searches will be more difficult to perform, merely that care has to 
be take to understand the biases introduced when using particular approximants.
To avoid this confusion, the phrase has been removed from the abstract.

>- Page 2, paragraph 3. The sentence that cites Ref. 34 says,
>"convergence is not gauranteed in this regime". My understanding was
>that it is not gauranteed in any regime that is relevant to compact
>binary searches.

This is a good point. We agree that convergence is not guaranteed in any regime 
that is relevant to compact binary searches. We have reworded the paragraph as follows
to clarify that we are refering only to the indistinguishability of approximants
from the perspective of advanced detectors. 

"While the convergence of the full PN series is not guaranteed, 
for BNS systems in Advanced LIGO, the available PN approximants produce
waveforms that are indistinguishable for a given binary and are 
reliable for use in detection searches and parameter measurement
[13, 14, 34]. However, for NSBH binaries the total mass, and hence the
PN expansion parameter v, is larger. The mass ratio and spin
corrections are also more significant."

>- Again, at the end of the first paragraph on page 6, the authors
>refer to a PN expansion that "has not yet sufficiently converged",
>suggesting that sometimes it *has* converged.

We have clarified our use of "sufficiently converged" to emphasize that our
measure is the reliability of use for parameter estimation.

"In both cases, however, we note that the additional terms have 
caused a significant change in the waveforms, as indicated by the low matches, 
demonstrating that the expansion has not yet sufficiently converged
to produce reliable waveforms for parameter estimation."

>- A 0.97 contour line on Fig. 13 would help in its interpretation

We indeed looked into doing this, but unfortunately the distribution 
of fitting factors is not quite smooth enough to permit a reasonable 
separation at this value. Fig. 13 projects  the total mass of the binary 
and the spin of the neutron star. While the spin of the black hole and 
the mass ratio are the dominant parameters, the total mass of the system 
does have an effect on the level of a percent or so. The grid spacing of 
the template bank also has an effect near this level.
