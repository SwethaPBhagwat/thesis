We would like to to thank the referee for their careful reading of this manuscript and their helpful suggestions, which have helped to improve this manuscript.  We believe that we have addressed the comments and respond in detail below.

We do not investigate the effects due to the neutron star's finite size and merger effects as no waveform model is currently available that includes these effects in addition to the effects of precession over the parameter space of interest. When such a waveform model is available the tests carried out in this work should be repeated to test if finite size NS effects will make any difference to our conclusions. However, as we restrict to total masses of 15 solar masses in this work the effect of the neutron's star size and merger effects will not be as important as for higher masses.

To address this concern we have added a new paragraph to the introduction to address this: 
"There has been a great deal of recent work focused on numerically 
modelling the merger of a black hole and a neutron 
star~\cite{Duez:2009yz,Shibata:2011jka,Pannarale:2012ux,Lackey:2013axa,
Foucart:2013psa}. However, there is not currently any widely available waveform 
model 
that includes both the full evolution of a \ac{NSBH} coalescence \emph{and} 
includes precessional effects over the full parameter space that we consider.
Therefore, in this work we have restricted ourselves to considering 
post-Newtonian, inspiral-only signal waveforms and consider only the case of two 
point particles. If a full 
inspiral-merger-ringdown, precessing \ac{NSBH} waveform model 
becomes available, it would be informative to compare results with that model 
against those presented here. However, in this work the black hole mass is 
restricted to be less than $15M_{\odot}$. It has been demonstrated that 
inspiral-only template banks recover $> 95\%$ of the signal power of 
numerically modelled $(3+15)M_{\odot}$ binary black hole 
waveforms~\cite{Brown:2012nn,Smith:2013mfa}. It has also been demonstrated that 
non-spinning \ac{NSBH} mergers with total mass $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ are 
indistinguishable from \ac{BBH} mergers with the same 
masses~\cite{Foucart:2013psa}. With these observations we expect that 
our results are qualitatively valid in the parameter space we study."

We have also added the following paragraph to the conclusion:
"In this work we have restricted ourselves to considering post-Newtonian,
inspiral-only signal waveforms and consider only the 
case of two point particles. This was done as there is not currently any widely 
available waveform model that includes both the full evolution of a \ac{NSBH} 
coalescence \emph{and} includes precessional effects over the full parameter 
space that we consider. When such a model is available it may be that 
tidal forces and the merger component of the waveform may effect our 
conclusions. We believe that such effects will be limited as the
black hole mass is $> 15 M_{\odot}$ in our simulations, however it would be 
informative to repeat our simulations when a full \ac{NSBH} waveform model is 
available."

The referee is correct that the results will be affected by the chosen signal distribution. In some cases we chose conservative choices for the parameter distribution (such as allowing a wider range of NS masses) to account for any affects of observational selection biases or systematic errors that may be present in current observations. For example in Astrophys.J. 757 (2012) 36 the authors argue that the black hole mass gap may be a result of systematic error in the determination of the BH mass. To address this we have reworded the text to clearly state the parameter distribution when first mentioned in the introduction, and no longer refer to this as "an astrophysical distribution". We still present the astrophysical considerations in section 2, but state the parameter distributions up front so it is clear what we have chosen. The third panel in Figure 11 now shows the minimum fitting factor, that is the *worst* possible fitting factor as a function of the black hole spin and the mass ratio. On this plot we are seeing fitting factors as low as 0.5 in some regions of the parameter space. We accept that averaging over the entire signal space is not an appropriate value to quote in the main results, therefore in the abstract, introduction and conclusion we state the result of (10,1.4) signals (with isotropic spin distribution) as one of our main results. In the introduction and conclusion we also state the values averaged over the whole parameter space, but are clear to state the assumptions in doing so.

We have added sentences to both the introduction and the conclusion to state that the results are dependent on the distributions that were chosen. As astrophysical knowledge improves, these tests can be repeated with different distributions in the future. Finally, we plan to add the raw results (system configurations, fitting factors with non-spin bank and aligned-spin bank for TaylorT2 and TaylorT4 configurations) to ArXiv and to the journal if possible. This will allow the interested reader to use our results and restrict to specific regions of parameter space as interested.

The neutron star spin is not negligible, by which we mean that if one were to take a NSBH waveform from our signal distribution, set the NS spin magnitude to 0.05 and match it with the same waveform with the NS spin set to 0 a match between ~0.8 and ~0.98 will be obtained. However, in our data set there is no noticeable correlation between fitting factor and NS spin, given the monte-carlo errors due to the finite number of simulations that we performed.

To illustrate this we have added a new plot, Figure 13, to the paper showing average fitting factor as a function of NS spin and mass ratio for the TaylorT4 aligned-spin template bank. No noticeable correlation is observable from the plot.

>templates a significant problem?

There is currently an increasing focus within LIGO and Virgo to be able to observe gravitational wave signals from BNS and NSBH mergers as quickly as possible. This will allow rapid sky localization of these sources and possible followup observations with electromagnetic telescopes. To do this requires search pipelines that operate quickly. By optimizing template bank placement to acheive necessary coverage with 20% less templates will mean that computing resources can be most efficiently utilized. The gain here can be used to tune the pipeline for increased sensitivity somewhere else. This may be the difference between (for e.g.) an EM observation of a highly spinning BH in a NSBH merger, or not making that observation.

It is also worth bearing in mind that a stochastic placement can leave gaps in the parameter space (as seen in the right panel of Figure 6) and can take some time to run. We do acknowledge that with our current implementations the geometric placement is actually *slower* than the stochastic placement, although we believe that significant increases in the placement speed can be acheieved. For the online searches this doesn't matter, as the bank is generated once, and then used as the data is received.

Nevertheless, in the interest of enabling *both* methods to possibly be used for NSBH/BNS searches of LIGO+Virgo data both our stochastic and geometrical placement algorithms have been made available in the openly available LAL software repository and both are already being used by others in investigating possible BNS/NSBH searches in 2015 and beyond.

>"Over a wide range of masses..." -- make clear that the number quoted

>masses in this range (cf. G2 above).

We have edited this to state that a uniform distribution of masses was used and also added a similar statement in the conclusion.

>"We find there are regions in the NSBH parameter space where
>precession effects cause a significant reduction..." -- can these
>regions be succinctly described here?

We have added the following sentence: "These regions 
are those where the black hole's angular momentum is large in comparison to 
the orbital angular momentum."

>X-1 is likely to exceed 20 solar masses (cf. max of 15 assumed here).

We have rewritten the discussion of BH mass distribution to take these points into account. We now mention the presence of the mass gap, and include the observations of higher mass BH systems. We also make it clear that the distribution we choose is partly motivated by these considerations, but that the upper mass limit is chosen because we cannot justify using inspiral-only point-particle waveform models at higher BH masses.

We have added the comment: "However, it is expected that the black hole would
form first in the vast majority of cases, which would remove the
possibility of recycling.". The point about PSR J1748-2021B is well taken and we say "There is also evidence for ...", which we think is an appropriate statement here.

We have edited this to say that J0737-3039A has a spin period of 23ms and not given a value for \chi.

>Section III:

We have added this connection in the paragraph following the equations.

We agree that this sentence was unclear. We have reworded this as:
"We do not expect these terms to change the 
main conclusions of the work as the additional phase evolution terms will have little effect 
on the precessional evolution of a system."

>"It has empirically been found that TaylorR2F4 performs best..." --
>what is the metric for "best" and how is this known?

A detailed discussion of this is found in reference 13, which is cited at the end of the sentence. However, we agree that "best" in this sentence is ambiguous. Therefore we have reworded the sentence as "It has empirically been found that TaylorR2F4 matches best with TaylorT4 when ..." and leave an interested reader to follow the reference to see the plots that are in that work.

Not sure what to say here either.
>Section IV:
>
>"... use a lower frequency cutoff, f_min, of 15 Hz" -- is this too
>close to the 14 Hz waveform start (spectral leakage)?

No. Even at the highest masses we use it will take 6 seconds for a binary to evolve from 14Hz to 15Hz (and 60 seconds at the lowest end). This is 90 (900) cycles of the waveform, which is more than enough to avoid any spectral leakage. We acknowledge that such an effect might be a concern with a 40Hz lower frequency cutoff for the initial detectors, but will not be an issue with the Advanced detector design curves.

>"... will not match it exactly due to the discreteness of the bank."
>-- or differences in waveform families for h_s and the bank waveforms
>h, right?

Yes, we have edited this sentence to say this: "describes the fraction of \ac{SNR} that is lost due to the fact that the
template in the bank that best matches $h_s$ will not match it exactly due to
the discreteness of the bank and due to any disagreement between the waveform 
families used to model the templates and the signals"

>average is taken over.

Also taking into account one of the comments below, this paragraph has been reworked. It now begins with a description of the "average fitting factor" a mean over a set of measured fitting factors. We then state that this can be misleading as poorly aligned signals can affect the measure more than they should - why does it matter if a poorly aligned signal has a low fitting factor, it won't be seen anyway - and then define the effective fitting factor and from there the signal recovery fraction, which we use extensively later in the text.

>Section V:
>
>Could mention that the metric in Eq. (20) is the Fisher metric.

We have added a note saying this.

>"Using these coordinates, the parameter space is globally flat." --
>Presumably, this is true only for frequency domain waveforms, hence

The reason to use frequency-domain metrics is nothing to do with acheiving a globally flat parameter space. The template placement method used in all previous searches for gravitational waves in LIGO data (bar one stochastically placed bank) used a frequency-domain metric in a parameter space that is curved. The reason to use a frequency-domain metric is that it enables the Fisher matrix to be quickly solved and/or calculated for the large number of waveforms present in the bank. If it were possible to quickly solve the Fisher matrix in the time domain we might be able to use similar techniques to obtain a globally flat (or globally *almost* flat) parameter space.

We have added a few sentences to explain the motivation for using frequency domain waveforms "Obtaining an analytic solution for Eq. \ref{eq:cbc_metric} is much simpler in 
the frequency domain and therefore frequency domain waveform models are 
commonly used when placing a bank of 
templates~\cite{Owen:1995tm,Owen:1998dk,Babak:2012zx}. We follow that approach 
and consider only frequency-domain metrics here."

This paragraph was not very clear and there were a couple of places where "Euclidean" was used when "Cartesian" was intended. Indeed xi denotes the parameter space where g_{ij} is diagonalized and after the PCA is perfomed. It might be possible to do the PCA directly in the lambda coordinates but it was easier to see this and visualize this after transforming through a Cartesian coordinate system. Diagonalizing the parameter space is not a costly operation and once the PCA is performed, rotating to the xi frame is also a cheap operation and therefore the operation occurs as described in the text.

To address the concerns and make this clearer the paragraph now reads:
"To deal with the increased dimensionality of the space we perform two
coordinate transformations~\cite{Brown:2012qf,Ohme:2013nsa}. These two 
coordinate
transformations map points from the $\lambda_i$ coordinates into a
Cartesian coordinate system where the principal directions are mapped using
coordinates denoted by $\xi_i$. Specifically, the first coordinate 
transformation uses the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of the $\lambda_i$ metric to transform to a Cartesian
coordinate system. A Principal Component Analysis is then performed to rotate
into the frame given by the principal directions of the parameter space."

Yes, some may not correspond to a physical solution (after all the \xi space is 8-dimensional and the physical manifold is only 4-dimensional). We have reworked this paragraph to make this point clearer and note that the 0.9999 match is generally only found if the point is in the physical sub-space. We have also been careful to explain this process more clearly during the reworking of this paragraph.

This is a fair point, we have added a comment that if the bank is regenerated every O(hour) then this would not have a negligible computational cost. However, we strongly believe this process can be sped up significantly and that the cost of placing template banks will not be a problem for the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors.

Our geometrical aligned-spin algorithm, as well as the previous non-spinning geometrical placement algorithm used in many LIGO and Virgo science runs all *currently* require that the waveform termination frequency does not change over the parameter space. For BNS signals this is normally fine as the system will merge out of band, so simply modelling the waveforms with TaylorF2, starting the waveform at 40 (or 15)Hz and terminating the waveform at the Nyquist frequency will produce a waveform that should have a high match with Nature's model. However, for NSBH systems some systems will reach ISCO as low as 240Hz, here assuming that the waveform continues up to ISCO is not a fair assumption. This is the reason why we explore the effect of using different termination frequencies to model *all* our NSBH signals, and why we compare to a stochastic placement where the termination frequency of the waveforms *can* be allowed to vary over the parameter space. We find that using 1000Hz as the termination frequency for NSBH waveforms will cause some overcoverage in the high mass areas of the parameter space, but will cover the low mass end of the space. Using lower values of the termination frequency will reduce coverage in the low mass end of the space, but also reduce template number. 

This point was not made clearly in the text however, we have reworked the paragraph in section IV to try to make this point clearer: "In contrast to \ac{BNS} mergers, \ac{NSBH} systems can merge in
the sensitive band of the advanced detectors. Existing non-spinning
template placement algorithms
\cite{Poisson:1995ef,Owen:1995tm,Owen:1998dk,Babak:2006ty,
Cokelaer:2007kx}, as well as our aligned-spin algorithm must use the same 
termination frequency when modelling waveforms across the parameter space. 
The standard approach is to assume that the waveforms will follow the TaylorF2, 
or TaylorR2F4, evolution up to the Nyquist frequency, usually 2048Hz. For 
\ac{BNS} systems, the merger generally occurs above 1000Hz where the 
sensitivity of
gravitational wave interferometers falls off and therefore little power is
incurred between 1000Hz and Nyquist. Even a $(3 + 3)M_{\odot}$ \ac{BNS}
has an \ac{ISCO} with a frequency of 730Hz. In contrast, a $(15 + 3)M_{\odot}$
\ac{NSBH} system has an \ac{ISCO} frequency at 240Hz. We must therefore
consider what frequency cutoff is most appropriate to use when placing a bank
of \ac{NSBH} waveforms."

>Section VI, last paragraph:

>When comparing to A^*_n, the authors point out that A^*_n requires

Unfortunately this is not possible to do. The An^*_n lattice is different to (for e.g.) the less efficient cubic lattice or a stochastic lattice. You cannot generate a A^*_n with the same fit distribution as a cubic or stochastic lattice otherwise it would *be* a cubic or stochastic lattice. However, we do attempt to give the reader a sense of the performances of the various approaches in Figure 6, where you can see that the distribution of the stochastic bank is quite different from the geometric bank. To try to be fair to the A_n^* bank, we do give bank sizes for minimal matches of 0.96 and 0.97. The fact that the 0.96 bank is still larger than the 2D bank shows that A_n^* is not suitable **for this application** but may prove useful in other applications. From the Conway and Sloane reference, and gravitational-wave related papers on bank placement (e.g. Prix et al., Messenger et al., Harry et al.) it is normal to compare banks by the number of templates per unit volume at a given minimal match (or "thickness"). We follow that standard here

However, we have added the option to do A_n^* lattice placement to the bank generation code that we have made available in the openly available LAL software repository. This will allow others to investigate this bank if so desired.

In general this is true if nothing is known about the orthogonality between A, B and C. However, we are using a Euclidean parameter space so a displacement in the \chi_1, \chi_2 plane is orthogonal to a displacement in the \chi_3 direction. In this case mismatches add linearly (as metric distances add in quadrature and mismatch is the metric distance squared). 

We added a short pointer to the text where this first appears to remind the reader that the mismatches being added are orthogonal.

This is a correct interpretation. We discovered this early in our work when
template bank placement failed miserably due to this disagreement. We decided
to split the work into two and have one work (this one) focus on the effect of precession and the other focus on the effect that waveform disagreement would have on detection efficiency and faithfulness. These results, in arXiv:1307.1757 show a considerable disagreement. We have added some more pointers to the companion work and have edited the introduction and conclusion to make it clear that we are focusing on the precession problem and leave waveform disagreements to the companion paper.

>Section VIII.A
>
>You use the terms "mean fitting factor" and "signal recovery fraction"

>"effective fitting factor" defined earlier (the latter, I presume).

We have added a few words to introduce the mean (and median) fitting factors as the mean/median value over the entire signal distribution. Signal recovery fraction is related to effective fitting factor. As the term "effective fitting factor" is not widely used, and is difficult to explain concisely, we decided to instead use "signal recovery fraction" throughout the work. This term is defined and compared to effective fitting factor in section 4. The first time that signal recovery fraction is used in section 8, we now point the reader back to section 4 to the original definition.

>Fig. 6 caption: which waveforms are used (only the template bank is
>mentioned in the caption).

This has been added to the caption, which now reads: "Fitting factor between a set of aligned-spin \ac{NSBH} signals
and a template bank of aligned-spin waveforms for varying values of the upper
frequency cutoff used in the construction metric. Shown for template banks
placed using the TaylorF2 metric and with both templates and signals 
modelled using the TaylorF2 approximant (left). Also shown for template banks
placed using the TaylorR2F4 metric and with both templates and signals 
modelled using the TaylorR2F4 approximant (right). The
performance of using a stochastically placed template bank with varying upper
frequency cutoff is also plotted. Results obtained
using the zero-detuned, high-power advanced LIGO sensitivity curve with a 15Hz
lower frequency cut off."

We have altered the plot labels and the text to adopt this convention.

Yes. This note has been added to the text: "This is most prominent when the mass ratio and the \ac{BH} spin magnitude are large, ie. where the black hole's angular momentum is particularly large relative to the orbital angular momentum. "

>Fig. 11: change of scale on bottom left subplot relative to bottom

The bottom left sub-plot of Figure 11 shows the minimum obtained fitting factor, for each value of mass ratio and black hole spin. This plot is not directly comparable to the signal recovery fraction plotted on the bottom right subplot or Figure 10. As we say in the text "The Figure serves to highlight that there are certain systems .. where precessional effects cause NSBH signals to have large mismatches with a bank of aligned-spin templates".

We have re-made the figure to use the value of J dot L at 60 Hz, which is the point at which half of the signal power has accumulated. J dot N does not evolve appreciably, so we continue to use the initial value. We have reworded the figure caption to say "...$\hat{L}$ denotes the orbital angular momentum when the gravitational wave frequency is 60 Hz (at which point half the signal power has accumulated)." 

The referee also questions why there are points with J.L close to 1 that have low fitting factors. These points also have J.n = 0 (ie. they are side on). These points are ones where there is very little signal power, and the effect of the evolving precession cone has a disproportionately large effect. For the points where J is perpendicular to both L and N, the lack of systems with high mismatch is in accord with the Brown, Lundgren, O'Shaughnessy model.

As requested we have added colour coding to this figure.

We have reworked this paragraph to address these concerns. A sentence has been added to define the fractional increase as the ratio of the singal recovery fractions for non-spinning and aligned spinning banks. A few sentences at the end of the paragraph have also been added to remind the reader that we are comparing performance at a fixed SNR threshold and not a fixed FAP threshold and point the reader to the discussion in the conclusion.

The paragraph now reads:

"We can also compare these results to the results we obtained using a
non-spinning template bank in section \ref{sec:non_spinning}. In 
Fig.~\ref{fig:aspinimpr} we show the fractional increase in the number
of recovered signals between using non-spinning and aligned-spin template banks
for the TaylorT4 approximant. The fractional increase in the number
of recovered signals is calculated by taking the ratio of the signal recovery 
fraction when using a non-spinning bank and the signal recovery fraction when 
using an aligned-spin bank. This figure helps to
emphasize that a much greater fraction of systems with large spin would be
recovered when using an aligned-spin templatebank. In Table 
\ref{tab:results_summary} we summarize the average signal
recovery fractions for the aligned-spin banks and
compare these numbers to the results obtained with non-spinning template banks. 
We remind the reader that for these plots we are comparing signal recovery at a 
fixed signal-to-noise ratio. However, signal recovery at a fixed false-alarm 
probability will depend on other factors, including the size of the parameter 
space covered by the template bank and the non-Gaussianity of the data. We 
discuss this further in the conclusion."

We believe that this discrepancy was caused by an error made in [33] where the
simulation distribution strongly favoured simulations that did not have a large
precessional effect. We have heard this in informal conversations with the
authors, but have not had this officially confirmed and cannot therefore say
this here. Therefore we have added a sentence to this paragraph reading. "It isn't clear why this discrepancy occurs, however it may be partially explained by the fact that the authors of \cite{Ajith:2012mn} used a lower frequency cutoff in their matched-filters of 20Hz, whereas we used 15Hz, which is more
appropriate for the predicted \ac{aLIGO} zero-detuned--high-power noise curve. "

>In the discussion of [47], you state that you are in qualitative
>agreement with that simpler model. How significant are the

We have added a brief quantitative comparison with the sentences:

We also obtain quantitative agreement by comparing our simulations of generic precessing systems with T4 as the signal and template model with the values predicted by Eq. 46b of \cite{Brown:2012gs}. We find that 90\% of the fitting factors are within $0.03$ of the predicted values.

The authors of that work plan to use the simulations in this paper as part of further studies of this model. We have added a sentence to the paper to say that this
will be explored further in future work.

We have removed this sentence from the conclusion. The paragraph already ends
with "leave a detailed investigation of such effects to future work" and these
effects definitely warrant further investigation.

To first order, yes. We have editing this sentence to read: "To achieve higher fitting factors will require more template waveforms, covering a larger signal
space"

>"... a factor of 10 increase in the number of independent templates
>will only increase the expected SNR of the loudest background event by

Yes, this is based on the Gaussian FAP assumption using the calculation
described above. We have added a note to this effect in the text.

In fact the black hole spin can be larger than the orbit even at 15Hz (though this does require a large mass ratio). We have modified the statement to read: 
"The angular momentum
of the black hole is expected to be comparable to the orbital angular momentum 
when the system is emitting gravitational waves in Advanced LIGO's and Advanced 
Virgo's sensitive band."

The first time this is used the text has been altered to read.

non-spinning systems.
