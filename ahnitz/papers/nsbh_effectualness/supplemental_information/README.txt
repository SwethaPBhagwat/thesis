The data for each of our results is presented in ASCII space separated text files. We provide the following configurations:

T2T2_nonspin.dat -> Non spinning template bank created using TaylorF2 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT2; Signals modelled by TaylorT2.
T4T4_nonspin.dat -> Non spinning template bank created using TaylorR2F4 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT4; Signals modelled by TaylorT4.
T2T4_nonspin.dat -> Non spinning template bank created using TaylorF2 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT2; Signals modelled by TaylorT4.
T2T2_alignedspin.dat -> Aligned spin template bank created using TaylorF2 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT2; Signals modelled by TaylorT2.
T4T4_alignedspin.dat -> Aligned spin template bank created using TaylorR2F4 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT4; Signals modelled by TaylorT4.
T2T4_alignedspin.dat -> Aligned spin template bank created using TaylorF2 metric; Templates modelled by TaylorT2; Signals modelled by TaylorT4

Each of the columns in the file represents the following

NOTE: When describing spins the z direction represents the direction from the source towards an observer. The orbital angular momentum at the start point of the waveform evolution (14Hz for these simulations) is defined to lie in the x-z plane.

Column:

1) Mass of the neutron star (solar masses)
2) Mass of the black hole (solar masses)
3) Polarization phase (radians)
4) Latitude of the source (radians)
5) Longitude of the source (radians)
6) Inclination angle of the source (radians)
7) Magnitude of neutron star dimensionless spin in the x-direction
8) Magnitude of neutron star dimensionless spin in the y-direction
9) Magnitude of neutron star dimensionless spin in the z-direction
10) Magnitude of black hole dimensionless spin in the x-direction
11) Magnitude of black hole dimensionless spin in the y-direction
12) Magnitude of black hole dimensionless spin in the z-direction
13) Mass of the black hole in the template that best matches the waveform.
14) Mass of the neutron star in the template that best matches the waveform.
15) Sigma (in Mpc) as defined in eq. (19) of this work and (4.39) of http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1514
16) Distance (in Mpc) at which this source would have an SNR of 8.
17) Value of the spin of the black hole in the template that best matches the waveform (negative indicates anti-aligned spin)
18) Value of the spin of the neutron star in the template that best matches the waveform (negative indicates anti-aligned spin)
