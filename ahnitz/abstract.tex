In this dissertation we study gravitational-wave searches for 
binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole coalescences. 
We determine the accuracy of post-Newtonian approximations as gravitational-wave
templates in matched-filter based searches for NSBH mergers.
We test a geometric method to generate template banks for BNS and NSBH mergers where
the components have intrinsic spin, and estimate the sensitivity to
astrophysical sources of searches that use these banks during Advanced LIGO.
We explore simplifications and optimizations to the search pipeline used 
during S6/VSR2,3 gravitational-wave searches. We investigate methods for regenerating
template banks as the noise behavior of a detector changes over time. We further
investigate changes to the algorithim for determining coincidence between
candidates from multiple-detectors.
Finally, we develop a focused search for binary neutron stars, and test improvements
to its configuration using LIGO detector data from the most recent science
run.
