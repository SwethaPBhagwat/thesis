To address this point we have added a paragraph before the "The paper is organized as follows" paragraph at the end of the introduction to address this concern. This paragraph states the 4 analyses and gives the requested information, we have also reworded the "The paper is organized as follows" paragraph to be clearer. This now reads:

"""
The paper contains 4 analyses: First, an unmodelled search for the 7 blind 
injections. Second, a modelled search for the 7 blind injections using 
frequency domain TaylorF2 waveforms for templates with total mass $<25 
M_{\odot}$ and effective-one-body inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms for total 
mass $>25 M_{\odot}$. Third, a followup parameter estimation analysis on the 7 
blind injections using three inspiral-merger-ringdown templates---PhenomB with 
no spin, EOBNRv2 and PhenomB with aligned spins. Finally, a large-scale 
simulation campaign, adding a large number of the submitted NR waveforms to the 
NINJA-2 recolored data and attempting to recover these with the modelled 
search pipeline. 

The paper is organized as follows:
In section~\ref{sec:waveforms} we briefly summarize the waveform
catalogue described more fully in~\cite{Ajith:2012az}.
Section~\ref{sec:noise} describes the LIGO/Virgo data used and the
processing that was done to make it resemble anticipated
advanced-detector noise.  Section~\ref{sec:parameters} describes how
the parameters for the blind injections were chosen, reports the values 
that were selected and describes the distribution of parameters used for the 
large-scale simulation campaign.
Section~\ref{sec:pipelines} describes the various detection and parameter 
estimation algorithms that were used in our analyses.
Section~\ref{sec:searches} reports the results of the unmodelled and modelled 
searches for the 7 blind injections.  Section~\ref{sec:param_estimation} 
describes the results of the parameter estimation analysis on the blind 
injections. 
Section~\ref{sec:sensitivity} describes the results of 
the large scale simulation campaign, which aims to quantify the sensitivity 
of the detection searches to the different hybrid waveforms. We conclude in 
section~\ref{sec:conclusions} with a discussion of 
how well the various algorithms performed, and implications for the
Advanced detector era.

We considered the possibility of merging section 4 into section 5, but did not believe that this would help the overall clarity of the paper. We felt that it
was important to give the details of the blind injection and simulation campaign
parameters in a dedicated section and not bury this in the detailed description
of the various analysis algorithms. 

However, we agree with the referee's point that this section could be explained
more clearly. We have added a few sentences to help this and this now reads:

"""
As well as these blind injections, a large number of (non-blind) simulated 
signals were subsequently analyzed to obtain sufficient statistics to adequately
evaluate the sensitive distances at which the NR waveforms could be detected 
in the early aLIGO and early AdV simulated data sets. As mentioned in 
section~\ref{sec:waveforms}, 
each of the NR waveforms is valid only at the values of mass ratio and 
dimensionless spins for which it was generated. However, it is possible to 
change the total mass, which just rescales the waveform, and the various 
orientation and location parameters, which will only affect the overall phase 
and amplitude of the signal. For each of the 60 NR 
waveforms given in Table~\ref{tab:ninja2_submissions1} and used in results in 
section \ref{sec:sensitivity}, a set of $\sim42000$ 
simulated signals was generated, necessarily with mass ratios and 
spins that have values corresponding to the given NR waveform. The total mass
was chosen ...

This equation has been corrected to quote the FAR as simply the number of background events louder than threshold divided by the total background time. We have also reworked the sentences surrounding this equation and added two citations to provide additional details. This now reads

"""
All triggers are then 
ranked according to their $\hat{\rho}$ in each of the mass/duration and 
coincidence sub-categories independently, allowing us to estimate the 
trigger false alarm rate (FAR) at a given threshold $\hat{\rho}=\hat{\rho}_{0}$.
This is described by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FARdef}
\mathrm{FAR}~(\hat{\rho}_{0}) \simeq \frac{N(\hat{\rho}\geq 
\hat{\rho}_{0})}{T_{c}},
\end{equation}
i.e.\ the number of background noise triggers in a given coincidence 
sub-category at least as loud as the threshold, $N(\hat{\rho}\geq 
\hat{\rho}_0)$, divided 
by the total time analyzed for that sub-category, $T_{c}$. The limiting 
precision on this quantity is of order $1/T_c$; thus, in the limit where 
\emph{no} background events are louder than $\hat{\rho}$, we quote a FAR of 
less than $1/T_c$. The calculation of trigger FARs is described in more detail 
in~\cite{Keppel:2009,Abbott:2009tt}.
"""

We have also made an additional minor revision in response to external comments received after submission of the paper:

  * We have edited the description of the "optimal" aligned spin search sensitivity prediction in section 8 to give a clearer description of how this prediction was obtained.
