%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Acknowledgements

Over the past five years, I have worked, interacted and made friends with many 
physicists, specially through my membership in the LIGO-Virgo and NINJA
collaboratons and interactions with the SXS collaboration.
Unfortunately, space makes it impossible to thank them all
individually and I hope anyone I do not mention here will forgive me.

\noindent I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown. His vast
knowledge of and passion for gravitational-wave astronomy never ceased to 
inspire me. I am specially indebted to him for his encouragement and for
allowing me freedom to pursue scientific ideas.

\noindent I would also like to thank the other members of my defense committee --- Marina
Artuso, John Laiho, Carl Rosenzweig, Peter Saulson, and Jason Wiles ---
for taking time out of their busy schedules to read and critique my work.

\noindent I am grateful to Syracuse University gravitational-wave faculty,
Peter Saulson and Stefan Ballmer, for their many excellent questions 
regarding my work, and valuable insights into the inner workings of the 
LIGO detectors. I would specially like to thank my academic adviser Peter
Saulson, for his patience and candid advice.


\noindent To Ian Harry and Eliu Huerta, I want to extend my gratitude for helping
me with much of what I learned during my research at Syracuse. And also for 
all the beer we shared.


\noindent On the data analysis side of the LVC, I would like to thank Thomas Dent, 
Collin Capano, Larne Pekowsky, Satya Mohapatra, Kipp Cannon. 


\noindent I would also like to thank Alex Nitz, Ryan Fisher and Satya Mohapatra,
for all of the conversations and questions every Friday morning. I want to thank
Peter Couvares for all his help with Condor and friendly conversations about 
computer science and things. 



\noindent I have learnt a great deal working with Numerical Relativists on the NINJA-2
and template bank projects. I would specially like to thank Harald Pfeiffer, 
Mark Scheel, Bela Szilagyi and Christian Ott for listening to and 
critiquing my work.


\noindent This would also be the right place to express my gratitute towards
my previous mentors, Badri Krishnan and Anu Gupta. Their encouragement and advice
helped shape my research interests.


\noindent It has been a pleasure to share an office with Matt West, Jim Lough, 
and T J Massinger, and I want to thank them for their innumerable help and 
for bearing with me.


\noindent None of this would have been possible without the love and support of
my parents and family, and I am deeply indebted to them. This would also 
be the right place to thank my friends for all the good times and incisive
conversations, specially Antonio, Shiladitya, Ishaan, Pavan, Jayanth, Medhavi,
Mandeep, SriKrishna, Sai, Harmish, PP, Sapan, Amandeep, Matt W, Matt H, 
Auritro, Sandeep, Arun, Hardik, David, Aniruddha, Mike, Chitra, 
Nitin, and Hooda, in no particular order.


\noindent Finally my sincerest gratitute goes towards all the physicists and mathematicians
before my time, on whose shoulders we are standing. 
Without their curiosity and perseverence, we would still be at the center of our
solar system.
Specially, I would like to thank Late Richard Feynman, whose verbose thinking
and flair for simplification and visualization instilled in me a passion for the
subject.

% majority I must omit will forgive me.
% 
% I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown.  I
% have benefited immensely from Duncan's vast knowledge of and passion
% for gravitational-wave astronomy.  I could not have asked for a better
% mentor, nor did I ever expect to find one with whom I could share so
% many laughs.
% 
% I would also like to thank Andrew Lundgren, with whom I worked on
% detchar.  Andy was great fun to work with, and his brilliance is
% matched only by his passion for squashing glitches in the detectors.
% Much of this work was also done with Josh Smith, to whom I am also
% grateful.
% 
% I am indebted to the other members of the Syracuse University
% gravitational-wave faculty, Peter Saulson and Stefan Ballmer, for their
% many excellent questions and suggestions regarding my work, and clear
% and detailed explanations of their own.
% 
% The NINJA project has introduced me to a great many numerical
% relativists from whom I have learned a great deal.  I would like
% especially to thank Mike Boyle, with whom I worked on the studies in
% chapter~\ref{ch:comparison}, Harald Pfeiffer, and Deirdre Shoemaker.
% 
% On the data-analysis side of NINJA, I would like to thank Satya
% Mohapatra for his help in testing the data sets and numerous other
% contributions as well as many fascinating conversations at

% Once this thesis exceeded 256 pages, my advisor challenged me to write 512. At
% first I did not think that would be possible. But as I sit here contemplating
% all the people that have my appreciation, I realize I could easily reach that
% number, and exceed it. Still, for the sake of brevity, and the members of my
% committee, I must limit my acknowledgements to a few individuals. I hope anyone
% I do not mention here will forgive me.
% 
% First, I would like to thank my advisor, Duncan Brown. Had he not asked me what
% I was planning to do three years ago for a research topic, I would not be here
% today. His mentorship, and his friendship, have made this all possible.
% 
% I would also like to thank the other members of my defense committee --- Peter
% Saulson, Stefan Ballmer, Britton Plourde, Alan Middleton, and Scott Sampson ---
% for taking time out of their busy schedules to read and critique my work.
% 
% I have learned much from all of the members of the LIGO Scientific
% Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration. I would particularly like to thank
% Ian Harry, Dave McKechan, Thomas Dent, Duncan Macleod, Steve Fairhurst,
% Stuncan, Alan Weinstein, Drew Keppel, and Kipp Cannon for all their help, and
% for collaborating with me on a number of projects. A special thanks also goes
% to Andrew Lundgren for knowing, well, everything.
% 
% Closer to home, I would like to thank the members of the Syracuse University
% Gravitational Wave Group, particularly Peter Couvares, for all of the
% stimulating discussions over coffee and noodle bowls. A special thanks goes to
% Matt West and Larne Pekowsky for entertaining my hair-brained ideas. I could
% not have asked for better office mates. I would also like to thank Larne for
% answering all of my UNIX questions, and for the shared experience of writing
% our dissertations.
% 
% Outside of the gravity group, I would like to thank David Niedzwieki and Don
% Bunk for all the laughs, awkward drawings, and unicorns. I am particularly
% indebted to the Vanderpools --- Scot, Jo, and Connor --- for opening up their
% home to me these past several weeks, and for all the free meals and games of
% Carcassonne they have shared with me the last three years. Thanks also to Jill
% Sneider, Janet Epstein, Kelly Sprinkle, and the men of AMI for giving me a
% sense of purpose and a diversion away from physics. Summers will never be as
% fun without playing softball with the members of the Bad News Bohrs; I shall
% miss them all terribly.
% 
% My life would not be the same without Kate Vanderpool. Her love and
% encouragement have made the last three years pass in a blink, and I cannot thank
% her enough.
% 
% I would like to thank my step-mother, Teresa Capano, for her guidance. A
% special thanks goes to my late Uncle Philly; without his financial support
% attending college would have been a challenge. And of course, I am eternally
% grateful to my father, for giving me an appreciation for all Nature's
% mysteries, and my mother, for giving me the drive to see my studies through.
% 
% Finally, I would like to thank Syracuse University and the SU Physics
% Department for giving me the opportunity to undertake both graduate, and
% undergraduate studies at their institution. I came to Syracuse almost ten
% years ago to the day, in August of 2001. In that time I have met and befriended
% many wonderful people, some of whom have gone on to bigger and better things.
% It feels odd to be the one leaving Syracuse now, but I will always hold the
% city, the university, and the people I have met here close to my heart.
