I would first like to thank my advisor, Peter Saulson, for his continued mentorship. Your experience, knowledge, 
and passion for teaching have inspired me. You always made sure that I understood the big picture and 
for that I am grateful.  

The Syracuse University Gravitational Wave Group is a truly unique group of people. Diverse scientific interests, 
expertise, kindness, willingness to teach, and group meetings full of bagels create an environment that fosters 
the development of graduate students and I wouldn't trade my experiences here for any other group in the LSC. 

I would like to thank my officemates: Prayush Kumar, Jim Lough, Chris Biwer, Alex Nitz, Soumi De, and Steve Reyes. 
Thank you for all of the companionship and for putting up with my horrible jokes. I expect you to continue them 
once I leave. 

To Ryan Fisher, thank you for making sure we enjoyed every minute of our conference travel and for all of the 
advice and mentorship you've provided. 

To the Detector Characterization group: Josh, Andy, Gaby, Peter, David, Jess, Laura, Ryan, Duncan, Marissa, 
OG Thomas, Nutsinee, Joe, and everyone else. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you for the last 
4 years and you've 
all taught me something valuable along the way. I always look forward to the next face-to-face meeting.

To Matt, Danica, Will, Allie, and Joel, thanks for making Syracuse a fun place to live. You are all awesome and 
I hope we don't end up too far away from each other. 

To Mom, Dad, Tim, and Lauren, thank you for always supporting me in everything I've done. 

To all of the Millers and Meszlers, thank you for being a second family to me.
