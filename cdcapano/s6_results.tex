\ac{S6} began on 7 July 2009 and ran until 20 October 2010. It overlapped two Virgo runs: \ac{VSR2}, which ran from 7 July 2009 to 11 January 2010, and \ac{VSR3}, which ran from 11 August 2010 to 20 October 2010. A number of improvements were made in both instrument hardware and \ac{CBC} analysis software between \ac{S5} and \ac{S6}. The software improvements have already been detailed in prior chapters: New \ac{SNR} was developed to replace effective \ac{SNR}, and Pipedown was implemented.

In this chapter we detail the \ac{S6} and VSR2/3 analysis. Section \ref{sec:hardware_improvements} describes some of the hardware improvements made to the detectors between \ac{S5} and \ac{S6}. In section \ref{sec:s6_epochs} we describe each of the four epochs the analysis was broken into. Section \ref{sec:dq_issues} details some of the major \ac{DQ} issues that arised during \ac{S6} and how they were dealt with, along with tuning decisions made. In this section we give an example of a veto developed from the loudest-slide studies that were implemented in the second half of \ac{S6}. Finally, in section \ref{sec:s6_results_and_big_dog} we give the results of the search, and we describe a blind injection that was made, and found, during \ac{S6}/VSR3. We do not present upper limits here as they are still being computed.

\section{Hardware Improvements}
\label{sec:hardware_improvements}

The two $4\,$km \ac{LIGO} interferometers, H1 and L1, were used for \ac{S6}.
The $2\,$km Hanford detector, H2, that is described in the last chapter was not
operational. Several hardware changes were made to the \ac{LIGO} detectors so
that prototypes of advanced LIGO technology could be installed and tested. This
included the installation of a more powerful, $35~\mathrm{W}$ laser, and the
implementation of a DC readout system that included a new Output Mode Cleaner
on an advanced LIGO seismic isolation table~\cite{Adhikari:2006}. In addition,
the hydraulic seismic isolation system was improved by fine-tuning its
feed-forward path. Known as HEPI feed-forward, this improvement was implemented
in January of 2010; it is described in more detail in section \ref{sec:s6b},
below.

Several hardware enhancements were also made to the Virgo detector in the
period between \ac{VSR1} and \ac{VSR2}. A more powerful laser was installed,
along with a thermal compensation system and scattered light was better
mitigated. During early 2010, monolithic suspension was installed, which
involved replacing Virgo's test masses with new mirrors hung from fused-silica
fibers. Following this upgrade Virgo began \ac{VSR3}. 

The average sensitivity of the detectors to binary coalescence signals in each epoch is shown
in Figures \ref{fig:s6a_insprange} -- \ref{fig:s6d_insprange}. These figures show the distance at
which an optimally oriented and located binary would produce a \ac{SNR}
of $8$ in a given detector. The figures show how the detectors were improved over the course of the run, until the eventually surpassed the best \ac{S5} ranges. 

\section{S6 Epochs}

\ac{S6} and VSR2/3 were broken into four epochs: \emph{S6A}, which ran from 7 July 2009 to 1 September 2009; \emph{S6B}, 24 September 2009 to 11 January 2010; \emph{S6C}, 6 February 2010 to 25 June 2010; \emph{S6D}, 26 June 2010 to 20 October 2010. Figure \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time} shows a plot of the \ac{BNS} inspiral range (with each component mass $= 1.4\,\Msun$) across all of \ac{S6} and the span of each epochs. The start and end times of the epochs were based on a combination of instrumental and analysis factors. S6A ended at a pre-planned commissioning break to try to improve the detectors after learning lessons from the first two months of running. S6B ran from the end of the commissioning break until the end of \ac{VSR2}. At this point, Virgo was taken off line for eight months in order to install the monolithic suspension. S6C therefore consisted only of double coincident time between Hanford and Livingston. Another commissioning break was taken at the end of S6B, hence the gap between the end of S6B and the start of S6C. S6D was to begin when Virgo came back online in August of 2010. However, during S6C we noticed that templates with total masses $> 25\,\Msun$ often rang off due to glitches. Thus we decided to lower the low-mass template bank from $2 \leq \mtotal/\Msun \leq 35$ to $2 \leq \mtotal/\Msun \leq 25$. We wanted to do this as soon as possible, and so the somewhat arbitrary date of 26 June 2010 was chosen as the break between S6C and S6D. Aside from Virgo eventually coming back online, there were no major instrumental adjustments between S6C and D. There were, however, new vetoes implemented for S6D based on \ac{CBC} results in S6C. These new vetoes, as well as more details about the decision to lower the template bank, are discussed in section \ref{sec:dq_issues}. In the next few sections we give more details about each of the epochs.

\subsection{S6A}
\label{sec:s6a}

Being the start of a new Science run, the \ac{LIGO} detectors had lower sensitivity and more glitches in S6A than in later epochs. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time}. In fact, the S6A \ac{LIGO} ranges were somewhat lower than they had been during their peak sensitivity in \ac{S5}. Figure \ref{fig:s6a_insprange} shows the average inspiral range versus binary total mass during S6A as compared to best ranges of \ac{S5}. We can see that Virgo, however, showed much improvement over VSR1, and had better sensitivity than H2 at its best in \ac{S5}.

In the \ac{S5}-LV search false alarm rates were based on a likelihood statistic that took into account the relative sensitivites of various interferometer combinations. The sensitivies were used to apply a weighting factor to each coincidence type so that more senstive \ac{IFO} combinations were promoted, allowing false alarm rates to be computed once across all combinations (as opposed to using equal-weighted bins to compute combined \acp{FAR} from uncombined). This was implemented for two main reasons: first, with both H2 and V1 active, four interferometers had to be analyzed, which led to an unwiedly number of coincidence types and instrument times to consider. Second, Virgo's sensitivity was much lower than the \ac{LIGO} detectors in VSR1, and, due to high amounts of low-frequency noise, its low-frequency cutoff had to be set to $60\,$Hz. Thus its template bank was truncated to have a maximum chirp mass of $\sim2.6\,\Msun$ \cite{ref:s5lvc}. The probability that various coincidence types detected a \ac{GW} was therefore far from equal, and so some sort of re-weighting needed to be applied. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:s6a_insprange}, however, the range of V1 was substantially better in \ac{VSR2} --- better than H2 --- and we were able to lower its low-frequency cutoff so that it could cover the same mass range as \ac{LIGO}. Essentially, V1 had taken the place of H2. Further, since V1 was not co-located with the other detectors, we could slide all the instruments against each other, which allowed us to analyze all instrument times. (Recall from the last chapter that H1 and H2 could not be slid against each other because they were co-located, and so H1H2 time could not be analyzed.) For these reasons, compounded with the fact that the \ac{S5}-LV likelihood method was still being developed when S6A started, we decided to analyze \ac{S6} in the same manner as in the \ac{S5} 12-18 month search, using combined \ac{FAR} as our ranking statistic, and with all the coincidence types being given equal weight. We also used many of the same tuning parameters as the \ac{S5} 12-18 month search: the \ac{SNR} cut, $\chi^2$ and $r^2$ veto thresholds, chirp-mass bins, and size of the ethinca parameter all remained the same.

There were a few minor adjustements, however. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:pipeline_principles}, we switched to using 3.5 restricted \ac{pN} templates, although the template bank metric was still calculated using the 2\ac{pN} approximation. New \ac{SNR} was implemented as our ranking statistic for computing uncombined \acp{FAR} after it was noticed --- in the 12-18 month search and the S6A high-mass search --- that effective \ac{SNR} tended to over-weight triggers with statistically low $\chi^2$ values. Pipedown replaced older, more cumbersome, scripts to do post-\ac{HIPE} processing. As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:ihope_pipeline}, we decided to do coincidence clustering within each chirp-mass bin as opposed to across all bins, as done in the 12-18 month search. We also switched algorithms for computing combined \acp{FAR} from the method discussed in section \ref{sec:alternate_cfar_method} of Chapter \ref{ch:far} to using slide triggers' uncombined \acp{FAR}, discussed in section \ref{sec:multiple_templates}. This change had little effect on the analysis, as they are equivalent. In the 12-18 month search, \ihope was run on month-long blocks of data as opposed to the year-long block used in the \ac{S5} first-year search. We continued this trend of decreasing the analysis periods in \ac{S6}: in S6A we decided to try to run \ihope on week-long blocks, with a different analyst being in charge of each period. Thus, S6A was (initially) broken into 8 week-long runs.

Initially we also planned to use trigscan clustering in \verb|lalapps_inspiral| to cluster triggers across templates. However, we were surprised to find that trigger rates were much higher than in \ac{S5}. They were so high that trigscan clustering was unable to keep the rate low-enough for many Inspiral jobs to finish (recall from Chapter \ref{ch:ihope_pipeline} that a disadvantage of trigscan is that it cannot garauntee a maximum trigger rate). Many jobs took several days to finish, or would simply run out of memory. As a result, only two weeks out of the eight were able to finish. Figure \ref{fig:avg_rate_per_tmplt} shows a comparison of the average trigger rate-per-template between one of the weeks that finished (``S6aWk3") and one of the months from the \ac{S5} LV analysis (``lvMonth8") at each stage of the pipeline. The rate was clearly higher for both H1 and L1 at all stages in the pipeline. In particular, the rate at second inspiral (2 on the x-axis) was not much lower than first inspiral (0 on the x-axis), implying that $\chi^2$ was being calculated for a large number of triggers. As this comparison had to use one of the weeks that finished, the other weeks that did not finish most likely had an even higher rate as compared to \ac{S5}.

To mitigate the high rates we decided to switch from trigscan to time-window clustering. What size window to use was an open question and so we used the two weeks that completed to investigate various clustering windows. We aimed to find the smallest window that allowed the search to continue, and that resulted in the most efficient recovery of vetoes. Three windows were considered: $10\,$ms, $30\,$ms, and $100\,$ms. The $10\,$ms window was found to be too short: the trigger rates were still too high for many runs to complete. This left the $30\,$ms and $100\,$ms windows. Figure \ref{fig:roc_cluster_windows} shows an ROC plot using $30\,$ms and $100\,$ms clustering. Note that in this plot we also considered raising the low-frequency cutoff to $65\,$Hz. As can be seen, the $30\,$ms window with the standard $40\,$Hz low-frequency cutoff provided the best results. We therefore decided to use the $30\,$ms clustering for all of \ac{S6}. Why trigscan clustering did not work as well is an open question. It may have simply been due to the high trigger rate. Another possibility is the switch from 2\ac{pN} to 3.5\ac{pN} templates somehow affected its ability to properly cluster. We plan to re-address this before advanced \ac{LIGO}.

\subsection{S6B}
\label{sec:s6b}

S6B began after the commissioning break in September of 2009. While the sensitivity in H1 improved slightly, the sensitivity in L1 was lower than in S6A. Further, L1 struggled to stay in lock for most of the period, and so the duty cycle was much lower. This can be seen in \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time}: note that L1 is off for large periods of time. The cause for the trouble was largely due to weather. As stated above, S6B ran from September to January. Fall brings a number of storms to the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in heightened \emph{microseismic} ($0.1$--$0.35$ Hz) noise. This made it difficult to keep the interferometer in lock.

To mitigate the seismic problem at Livingston HEPI feed-forward was developed during S6B. HEPI stands for Hydraluic External Pre-Isolation. Many of the interferometer's optics are sit on tables housed in vacuum chambers. These chambers are situated on hydraulic actuators, which are used to dampen out seismic noise. In the feed-forward process, the output from seismometers on the floor were fed into the actuators to cancel out the seismic motion, much in the same way noise-cancelling headphones work \cite{ref:Lundgren_comm}. The digital filters used in the feed-forward were implemented and tuned across S6B. This led to L1 becoming more stable, allowing for longer lock stretches. The effect can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time}: a few days prior to 16 December L1 suddenly starts staying in lock for longer periods of time. The increased stability eventually also allowed the laser power to be turned up to $14\,$W\footnote{The laser power was set to $14\,$W at both H1 and L1 during the evening and on weekends --- when there was little seismic noise from human activity --- throughout S6C and D. During working hours, the laser was typical set to $10\,$W.} which in turn led to better range. Thus, although S6B largely had poor data, it resulted in better range later on.

Due to the poor sensitivity of the \ac{LIGO} detectors and L1's low duty cycle, we decided to analyze S6B in three chunks. The first lasted from the start of S6B until 11 November 2009, at which point the detectors were re-calibrated. The second and third chunks ran from 11 November to 11 December, and 11 December to 11 January, respectively.

\subsection{S6C}
\label{sec:s6c}

After V1 went offline in January of 2010, another commissioning break was taken to try to better improve the \ac{LIGO} detectors. Thus the S6C analysis began a couple of weeks after the end of S6B, on 6 February. As can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time} and \ref{fig:s6c_insprange}, the commissioning throughout S6A and B paid dividends during S6C and D: it was during these periods that the \ac{LIGO} detectors reached their peak sensitivity, surpassing that of \ac{S5}.

It was during S6C that Pipedown was completed,\footnote{Pipedown was used throughout S6A and B. However, for both of those periods, it could only produce tables of loudest zero-lag events and IFAR plots. An early form of the \ihope page and loudest events table was used for S6A. For S6B injection-finding, PrintMissed, and PrintSims tables were added. By S6C, loudest-slide tables were added along with PlotFM plots.} allowing for loudest-slide studies to be carried out. New data-quality tools were also finished, including daily \ihope and a DQ wiki page. This page, which was generated each week, brought together information from online analyses and veto tools, including daily \ihope, Omega online (a tool used by the Burst group of which Omega scans are apart), Hveto (for \emph{Hierarchical Veto}, this is a tool that hierarchically ranks various auxillarily channels as potential vetoes by the probability they caused triggers in the \ac{GW} channel \cite{ref:https://wiki.ligo.org/DetChar/HvetoDoc}), and UPV (for \emph{Used Percentage Veto}, this is a tool that looks for correlations between auxilarilly channels and the \ac{GW} channel; if a channel is strongly coupled for a set of triggers, it is used as a veto) \cite{ref:https://virgo.physics.carleton.edu/trac/UPV-trac/wiki}. We therefore implemented the following system to analyze the data:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Each week a different analyst would be assigned to do a \ac{DQ} study. This involved going through that week's DQ page and checking the e-log for potential issues that would affect the \ac{CBC} analysis. They would record their findings on the DQ page (being a wiki, it could be edited after it was generated) and present them on a weekly telecon devoted entirely to the S6 analysis.}
\item{A ``lead" analyst would run \ihope on two weeks' worth of data, with a ``second" providing support (e.g., if the lead could not make a call or was having trouble getting the analysis to complete, the second would provide help). We required that the lead analyst be one of the two people who did the DQ study for one of the weeks that the \ihope run covered. Thus the analyst would be intimately familiar with potential issues in his or her run.}
\item{The lead or second would generate a closed-box \ihope page after \ihope completed (typically a few days). We would look over the page on the S6 telecon, paying careful attention to loudest-slide events and nearby missed injections. We were particularily interested in slide events that had combined new \acp{SNR} greater than $11.3$ as this would prevent detecting a \ac{GW} with a \ac{SNR} $= 8$ in each detector. The DQ studies would be reviewed to see if any flags or events recorded in the e-logs could explain the loudest slides. If a flag was found that passed safety checks --- i.e., it did not veto injections --- it would be added to the veto-definer file as either a CAT2 or CAT3 veto. UPV vetoes were also added at this point at CAT3. The lead or second would then re-run second Thinca and Pipedown with these new vetoes (this typically took a few hours). The new closed-box page would be checked again to make sure no new vetoes could be derived and that there were no glaring problems. An open-box page would then be generated and presented on the full \ac{CBC} telecon to see if there were any \ac{GW} candidates.}
\item{This process would be repeated on successive weeks, with each new analysis using the updated veto-definer file from the previous two weeks. The analysis was thereby fine-tuned as S6C continued.}
\end{itemize}

This method of using loudest slide triggers resulted in a number of vetoes being generated specifically for the low-mass \ac{CBC} search. Many of these vetoes were one-time use flags that were based on a specific event that occurred at one of the detectors, such as a computer glitching on a paritcular day. However, the study did result in some long-term vetoes being implemented. Section \ref{sec:seismic_veto} gives an example of one of these vetoes. Routinely opening boxes also allowed us to decrease the latency between when data was taken and when results were obtained. By the end of S6C and throughout S6D we were opening boxes approximately two weeks after the data had been taken. 

The decision to decrease the low-mass template bank to $\mtotal \leq 25\,\Msun$ was made at the end of S6C based on results from obtained during the epoch. The decision was influenced by two points: first, we found that the templates in the $25$--$35\,\Msun$ range were often rung off by glitches. Nearly half of the top 10 loudest events came from this part of the bank in each of the two week periods, despite it covering less than a third of the total mass space. The loudest slide events in the medium and high chirp-mass bins were also largely dominated by this mass range. The other factor leading to the decision was that the high-mass \ac{CBC} search, which covers $25 \leq \mtotal/\Msun \leq 100$, overlapped the low-mass search in this region. This overlap was unneeded since the template placing algorithm in \texttt{lalapps\_tmpltbank} would adequately cover the $\mtotal = 25\,\Msun$ line within each search. We therefore had two questions to answer: first, what search did better in the $25 -- 35\,\Msun$ region, the low-mass or the high-mass? Second, if the high-mass search better and we reduced the low-mass template bank, what would the effect on the low-mass search be?

To answer the first question, we ran the low-mass search and high-mass pipeline on the same 3 weeks of data (weeks 11-14 of S6C) then compared how well they recovered injections in the overlap region. Figure \ref{fig:mass_investigation-plotfm_lowmass} shows the found/missed plot as a function of total mass in the overlap region for the low-mass search, and Figure \ref{fig:mass_investigation-plotfm_highmass} shows the same for the high-mass search. The high-mass search appears to do better: more injections are recovered at farther distances, and a few injections that were missed in the low-mass search are now found. That the high-mass search does better in the region is further supported by Figure \ref{fig:mass_investigation-plotroc}, which shows the ROC plot for injections in the overlap region.

The high-mass search clearly worked better in the overlap region, suggesting we should lower the low-mass bank. To see the effect a smaller bank might have on the low-mass search, a test run with the lower-bank was run over the first two weeks of S6C and compared to the original run, which had the full bank. Figure \ref{fig:smaller_bank_investigation-lowmass} shows the found/missed plot as a function of chirp-mass for the two runs (spinning injections are excluded in these plots). There are a few subtle differences. Several injections on the edge of the range are found with lower \acp{FAR} with the lower-bank. This is expected since the volume of parameter-space we are searching is smaller, effectively giving a smaller trials factor. Perhaps most notable is that a nearby injection that was missed with the full bank (the red-cross with a chirp mass of $\sim1.9\,\Msun$ and decisive distance of $\sim40\Mpc$) is found with 0 \ac{FAR} by the smaller template bank. This was investigated in more detail; it was found to have little to do with the choice of mass-range, however. For more details see section \ref{sec:mysterious_missed_injection}.

Only one injection jumps out as doing worse in the smaller-bank run: the one with $\mchirp \approx 3.8\Msun$ and decisive distance $\approx 18\Mpc$. In the full-bank run it was ``found", albeit with a large combined \ac{FAR} (signified by the orange dot in the full-bank plot). In the smaller-bank run it was missed (signified by the red cross). This injection never should have considered ``found" in the full-bank run, however: a followup investigation found that the injection was on top of a glitch. The glitch rang off a high-mass template; since \texttt{ligolw\_inspinjfind} only uses a time-window, it labelled it as ``found" even though the recovered parameters were not close to the injected. In the smalller-bank run, no templates were rung off by the glitch and so it was considered missed, as it should have been. Thus, this injections was another indication that the smaller bank was better suited for the low-mass search.
%Only two injections jump out as having worse \acp{FAR} with the smaller bank than with the full bank: an injection with $\mchirp \approx 3\Msun$ and decisive distance $\approx 30\Mpc$ (it is marked by a red dot in the smaller-bank plot) and an injection with $\mchirp \approx 4.5$ and decisive distance $\approx 20\Mpc$ (marked by a light-blue dot in the smaller-bank plot). Both of these were found with $0$ \ac{FAR} with the full bank. These two injections were both spinning injections, however. We know that we do not recover spinning injections very well Table \ref{tab:smaller_bank_investigation-spininj} shows more detail about these injections, including injected and recovered parameters. In both cases the triggers with the best combined new \ac{SNR} come from templates with higher masses than what was injected. This is due to the mis-match between spinning injections and the non-spinning bank. Most likely, because $\chi^2$ does not work as well with higher mass templates (as they have fewer cycles in band) injections ring off templates with higher masses than what was injected. 

Injections aside, another metric of interest was the effect of using the smaller bank on the loudest-slide events. Table \ref{tab:smalller_bank_investigation-loudest_slides} compares the three loudest slide triggers from the original run and from the new run. There was little difference in the low and medium chirp-mass bins, but the high mass bin shows clear improvement. The loudest high chirp-mass event with the full bank had a combined new \ac{SNR} of $11.78$ whereas with the smaller bank it is $9.64$. This means that an event in the high chirp-mass bin with \ac{SNR} $8$ in each \ac{IFO} (the \ac{SNR} on which we base projected detection capabilities) would now stick out above the background.

The lower-bank offered some clear advantages and little or no disadvantages. For this reason we decided that we should lower the bank for all subsequent runs. This decision was made as the analysis of the two weeks ending on 25 June 2009 was being completed. We therefore decided to stop S6C on that date, and have ``S6D" begin with the analysis starting on 26 June, with the smaller-bank in place. It was suggested that we go back and re-analyze all of the S6C weeks with the smaller bank. However, given the relatively minor differences in the found/missed plots, we decided against it. This decision was further bolstered by Figure \ref{fig:smaller_bank_investigation-roc}, which shows a ROC plot comparing the smaller bank and the full bank. The gain in volume was not considered large enough to warrant a re-analysis.

\subsection{S6D}
\label{sec:s6d}

The method of analyzing data on two week periods that was pioneered during S6C was continued throughout S6D. There were a few differences between S6C and D: in addition to reducing the template bank, described above, we also implemented two new automated vetoes: SeisVeto and a ``SNR $> 250$" flag. These are discussed in more detail in sections \ref{sec:lvea_seismic} and \ref{sec:spike_glitch}, respectively. The other major difference from S6C was that VSR3 began during S6D.

Virgo came back online on 11 August 2009 to begin VSR3. As mentioned above, in the break between VSR2 and VSR3, monolithic suspension was installed in an effort to increase Virgo's range. Unfortunately, a mirror with an incorrect radius of curvature was installed in the process. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:s6_insprange_v_time}, this resulted in V1 having lower sensitivity than it did in VSR2. V1 was also more glitchy.

Given Virgo's reduced sensitivity, we were concerned about leaving H1V1 and L1V1 doubles in triple time in the data. As explained in Chapter \ref{ch:far}, if we use all the possible coincidence types in triple time, we have a trials factor of 12 (4 coincidence types $\times$ 3 chirp-mass bins). This means that the combined \ac{FAR} of all (loud) triggers (for which all categories are active) will be 12 times larger than the uncombined \ac{FAR}. In doing so we have treated all the coincidence types with equal weight. However, with V1's reduced sensitivity, it was far less probable that an H1V1 or L1V1 trigger was a gravitational wave than H1L1 or H1L1V1 triggers. That the combined \ac{FAR} H1L1 and H1L1V1 triggers would gain a factor of 12 due to the much weaker H1V1 and L1V1 triggers would clearly be an over-estimation of the \ac{FAR}. The simplest fix was to simply throw out H1V1 and L1V1 triggers in triple time. This would decrease the trials factor in triple time to 6. Before doing this, however, we investigated what the effect of throwing out these triggers would be. Namely, we wanted to know if any injections would be missed, and we wanted to weigh this against the decrease in \ac{FAR} for H1L1 and H1L1V1 triggers.

In order to perform the study, two weeks of S6D/VSR3 data were used (from 3 September to 18 September 2010). Both \verb|ligolw_cbc_cluster_coincs| and \verb|ligolw_cbc_cfar| have the ability to remove specific coincidence types from a database; thus we simply re-ran cFAR on the Pipedown database generated by the standard run to re-compute the combined \acp{FAR} with the H1V1 and L1V1 doubles in triple-time excluded. 

Figure \ref{fig:V1doubles-found_missed-orig} shows the H1L1V1-time found/missed plot for the original run (with V1 doubles included); Figure \ref{fig:V1doubles-found_missed-excluded} shows the same, but with the V1 doubles excluded. Some injections do appear to be missed when the V1 doubles are excluded. To get a better handle on how many, and whether or not they are really ``found" injections (as opposed to being a glitch within the injection-finding window), the plots in Figure \ref{fig:V1doubles-coinc_types} were created. The top plot shows found/missed injections in H1L1V1 time as a function of coincidence type in the original run (with V1 doubles in). There are clearly some H1V1 and L1V1 injections, some of which have 0 combined \ac{FAR}. To get a sense of how many of these injections are true injections, the bottom plot shows the accuracy of the recovered chirp mass: ``found" injections around 0.0 are most likely real injections. When more detailed information was printed off for some of these injections, it was found that their effective distance in V1 was lower than that in H1 or L1, meaning that, despite Virgo's poor over-all sensitivity, there were still small areas in the sky to which V1 was more sensitive due to the antenna patterns.

Still, the relative number of H1V1 and L1V1 injections found as compared to H1L1 or H1L1V1 is clearly small. To weigh the gain in detecting these extra few injections against the cost of doubling the trials factor, the ROC plot in  Figure \ref{fig:V1doubles-roc} was created. This plot compares relative sensitive volume from leaving H1V1 and L1V1 doubles in triple time (blue curve) to excluding them (green curve). While the two curves are roughly the same at high \acp{FAR}, removing the doubles provides more sensitive volume at lower \acp{FAR}, which is the region of most interest since we would never claim a detection at the higher \acp{FAR}. Note in particular that at lower \ac{FAR} the green curve has approximately half the \ac{FAR} as the blue curve at the same relative volume, as expected from the reduction in trials factor. Based on these results and the small number of injections that would be missed, we therefore decided to exclude H1V1 and L1V1 doubles in triple time from the analysis for S6D.\footnote{Note that we still kept all triggers in H1V1 and L1V1 time. Since these times are mutually exclusive from H1L1V1 and H1L1 time, leaving them in the analysis had no effect on the \acp{FAR} of H1L1 and H1L1V1 triggers. Thus we only stood to gain by considering these times.}

\section{DQ Issues}

In the above sections we have covered some of the data quality issues that arose during S6 that resulted in tuning changes. These were the elevated trigger rate, the switch to a smaller template bank, and the decision to drop H1V1 and L1V1 coincidences in triple time during S6D/VSR3. Here we detail a couple of \ac{DQ} issues that we found during \ac{S6} and how we dealt with them. The two \ac{DQ} topics listed here are by no means exhaustive. They are simply meant to highlight some results from detailed loudest-slide and other DQ studies.

\subsection{The H1 \texttt{LVEA\_SEISZ} Veto: An Example Veto using Loudest Slides}

As described in section \ref{sec:s6c}, during S6C and D we used the loudest-slide triggers from the low-mass \ac{CBC} search to identify potential new vetoes. Many of the resulting vetoes were one-use flags based on observations noted in the e-log of some event at the detector sites. However, the loudest-slide results did result in a few vetoes that were used extensively. Here we present an example of one of those flags, the H1 \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| veto.

When we looked at the initial closed-box \ihope page for weeks 13 and 14 of S6C (1 May -- 14 May 2009), we found that the loudest slide trigger in the high chirp-mass had a relatively large combined new \ac{SNR} of 13.4. The \ihope analysis of the next two weeks (15 May -- 28 May 2009) also revealed a relatively loud slide trigger, this time in the medium mass bin with a combined new \ac{SNR} of 11.9. Table \ref{tab:seisz-loud_slides-pre_veto} lists some details about these triggers. There were no entries in either the Hanford or Livingston e-logs to suggest a cause for these events. However, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:seisz-loud_slides}, the Omega scans of the H1 \ac{GW} channel showed similar signatures. When a full-Omega scan was run of every channel at Hanford, we found considerable seismic noise occuring in the \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| channel during both events. Figure \ref{fig:seisz-omega_scans} shows the scan from this channel during these events. The \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| channel monitors vertical ground motion in the \emph{LVEA}, which is the building that houses all of the interferometer's central optics, such as the beam splitter, intermediate test masses, and dark port, as well as the laser.\footnote{The x and y channels also picked up motion. We used the z channel as it was found to be the most efficient at targeting resulting glitches in the \ac{GW} channel.}

We therefore developed a flag that monitored the RMS value of the \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| channel in the $3$--$10\,$Hz band \cite{ref:https://wiki.ligo.org/DetChar/H1LVEASEISZS6Cflag}. When the channel exceeded 1000 counts (counts are an arbitrary unit used for \ac{LIGO} channels; they are a measure of the amplitude of the channel), the flag would go off. Efficiency studies found the flag to be good at targetting noise transients caused by the seismic noise, with little ``deadtime" (this is how much time the flag is on for). It was therefore added as a CAT3 veto. Table \ref{tab:seisz-loud_slides-post_veto} shows the loudest events in the high and low chirp-mass bin in weeks 13 and 14 and weeks 15 and 16, respectively, after the application of the veto. The noise has dropped substantially, and is now below a combined new \ac{SNR} of $11.3$.

Initially, we only intended to use the flag for weeks 13-16 of S6C. Studies on the later weeks found that the flag became even more efficient, however, and so the flag was entered into online monitors as \verb|H1:DMT-BRMS_SEISMIC_LVEA_Z_3_10_HZ_THRESH_1E3|; it was used as a veto until the end of S6C. As we had already opened boxes on weeks 1-12, we did not apply it to those weeks. Further studies showed it would not have been as effective during those weeks, anyhow. Why this is, and what the cause was for the increased seismic noise in later weeks of S6C, is unknown. It may have been due to dam run-off near the Hanford observatory \cite{ref:Lundgren_comm}.

In S6D the \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| veto was superceded by SeisVeto. SeisVeto improved on \verb|LVEA_SEISZ| by used multiple seismic channels. The output from these channels were loaded into the Hveto algorithm along with daily \ihope triggers to find the strongest correlated channels each day. This automation gave even better efficiency with very little deadtime \cite{ref:https://wiki.ligo.org/DetChar/SeisVeto}. For more details on SeisVeto, see \cite{ref:SeisVeto} (in preparation).

\subsection{The ``Spike" Glitch}

One of the major \ac{DQ} issues of S6 was the ``Spike" Glitch. Beginning in August 2009, loud, short-duration ($\sim1\,$ms) glitches began to appear in the Livingston data. These glitches were characterized by a sharp downward ``spike" in the \ac{GW} channel followed by ringing (due to the response filters in the interfermeter); Figure \ref{fig:spike_glitch-closeup} shows a close-up of one. The glitch would vary in strength; some were so loud that they could be seen in the raw (unfiltered) time-series of the \ac{GW} channel. Figure \ref{fig:spike_glitch-example-time_series} shows the time series of an example loud spike and Figure \ref{fig:spike_glitch-example-omega_scan} shows the corresponding Omega scan. The high-amplitude noise surrounding the glitch is due to the ringing of Omega's whitening filters; despite the short duration of the glitch, it causes ringing that lasts for several seconds due to its high amplitude.

The spike glitch would also cause the \ac{CBC} matched filter to ring. Figure \ref{fig:spike_glitch-cbc_response} shows a typical response by \verb|lalapps_inspiral| when a spike glitch passes through; in this case the glitch was the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:spike_glitch-example}. This plot was created with the $2 \leq \mtotal/\Msun \leq 35$ template-bank, without any clustering. Each trigger is colored by its $\tau_0$ value, which essentially gives the duration of the template. The large spike in \ac{SNR} which begins at the time of the glitch ($0\,$s) is due to the impulse response of the templates. Although the \ac{SNR} of these triggers is quite large (in this case, the loudest template had a $\rho = 8300$), they did not typically show up in our loudest events nor our loudest slides. This is because they would have very poor $\chi^2$ values, resulting in low new \acp{SNR}. Of greater concern was the ``shoulders" surrounding the spike and the tail proceeding the glitch (which we called the ``penguin wing"). This tail could last several seconds after the glitch and its triggers could have lower $\chi^2$ values. We therefore wished to find the cause of the glitch, so that the detector could be fixed, or, if that was not possible, so we could veto it.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/spike_glitch/spike_glitch_example.png}
\label{fig:spike_glitch-closeup}
\caption{A close-up of a spike glitch. Shown is the \ac{GW} channel (\texttt{DARM\_ERR}) raw time series.}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, despite a number of intensive data-quality studies and feedback from instrumentalists, we were never able to determine the cause of the spike glitch. Not only did this prevent us from fixing the instrument so the glitch would go away, but it also made it difficult to veto. As stated above, we typically only veto triggers if they can be strongly correlated with an auxillarily channel. This is to avoid accidently vetoing a gravitational-wave. The spike glitch was clearly not a \ac{GW}, but we had no other way to veto it than to use the \ac{GW} channel. We therefore decided to use a flag based on daily \ihope triggers. Named \verb|H1:DCH-CBC_SNR_GT_0250|, this flag would go off whenever triggers exceeded a \ac{SNR} threshold of 250. The flag was used as a CAT3 veto in S6D, and a ``padding" of $\pm8\,$s was added to it. The padding was added to remove the ``shoulder" triggers created by the spike. $8\,$s was chosen based on the length of the inverse spectrum truncation.

There was some concern that vetoing triggers using the output of daily \ihope would cause us to miss a nearby event. However, any real \ac{GW} event that had a \ac{SNR} above 250 would stick above the background at CAT2. Since we check results after CAT2 vetoes have been applied, and the \ac{SNR} $> 250$ flag was applied at CAT3, this veto would not prevent us from detecting such an event.

%\subsection{Mysterious Missed Injection}
%
%In the smaller bank investigation described in section \ref{sec:s6c}, we noted that a \ac{BNS} injection that was in range was missed in the run with full template bank, but was found with zero combined \ac{FAR} with the smaller bank. (It can be seen as the red cross with $\mchirp \approx 3\,\Msun$ and decisive distance $\approx 40\,\Mpc$ in Figure \ref{fig:smaller_bank_investigation-lowmass-full_bank}.) We investigated this injection in more detail to understand why.

\section{Results}

As described in section \ref{sec:s6_epochs}, we initially analyzed the data in several small analysis periods --- weekly runs in S6a; three month-long chunks in S6B; bi-weekly runs in S6C and D --- and opened boxes on each of these analyses. We did this so we could obtain results quickly, and so we could pro-actively adapt the pipeline to \ac{DQ} issues, as detailed above. However, we did this with the knowledge that we would have to re-run the pipeline over these periods. Re-runs were required in order to take advantage of final calibration studies, as well as fix minor issues in published veto segments.\footnote{Upon review, a CAT1 veto-flag was found to stay on (and off) for slightly longer periods than it should have. The effect on the analysis is small, amounting to a change in livetime of less-than a day across all of S6. For the sake of rigor, however, we have fixed the flag for re-runs.} For speed and simplicity these re-runs are being done in larger $\sim6$-week long chunks. S6A is being analyzed with one run; S6B is divided into two chunks, one prior to 11 November, and the other from 11 November to 11 January. S6C and D are each being re-analyzed in three chunks. Aside from the grouping of analysis runs together, no other changes have been made to the runs. For example, although new vetoes were created throughout S6C and D, these have not been retroactively applied to earlier periods.

As the changes between the original runs and the final re-runs are minor, we do not expect our result to change. The result of the S6/VSR2/3 analysis is:
\begin{center}
\textbf{No gravitational-wave candidates were detected.}
\end{center}
Currently, the most significant trigger is an H1L1 trigger in H1L1V1 time with a
combined FAR of \firstFAR. The second and third most significant triggers had
combined FARs of \secondFAR~and \thirdFAR, respectively. All of these triggers
are consistent with background: having analyzed
$\mathrm{\sim0.5~yr}$~of data, we would expect the loudest event to
have a FAR of \expectedLoudestFAR. Although no detection candidates have been found,
 we will perform detailed follow-ups on the loudest triggers in each epoch once the re-runs have completed. These followups are carried out to aid in future \ac{DQ} investigations.

As apart of the re-runs we are performing extra injection runs. This is so we can improve our statistics for placing upper-limits. Since these runs are still on-going, and since the final upper limits will need to be reviewed once they are produced, we do not present upper-limits here.

\section{The Blind Injection}

A hardware injection was injected into the \ac{LIGO} and Virgo detectors during
S6D/VSR3 without the search groups' knowledge. The purpose of this
\emph{blind-injection challenge} was to test the groups' abilities to detect
signals and to exercise the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations' procedures in the
event that a real gravitational-wave candidate is detected. The {\it blind
injection} was found by the \ac{CBC} group with a FAR low enough to be
considered a detection candidate. We treated the event as if it were real:
detailed studies were done to establish the significance and parameters of the
event, and to vet the detectors of any possible environmental or instrumental
causes. Only after all procedures were reviewed and a paper draft written was
the event unveiled as an injection.  Although the event was not real, we
present here details of the analysis of the injection, including methods used
to calculate its \ac{FAR}.

\subsection{Observation and FAR Estimation}

The blind injection occurred on \dogDate~at \injectedDogTime~(GPS time
\injectedDogGPSTime) and was identified by multiple searches. It was initially
observed, within a few hours, by a low-latency Burst search. Since Burst
searches use un-modelled waveforms, it did not give the event a \ac{FAR} small
enough to be considered a detection. However, it was signifcant enough to stand
out as a potential \ac{CBC} candidate, and so the collaboration was alerted to
its prescence in the data.

Although we knew about the potential candidate prior to opening the box, we carried out the analysis of the two weeks containing the event as we did every other period: a closed-box page was generated, loudest-slides were examined, vetoes were updated, and a CAT234 re-run was done to prepare for the open-box. The injection was loud enough in H1 that it showed up in the loudest H1L1 event in the medium chirp-mass bin during H1L1V1 time. In this event the injection in H1 was coincident with a random noise event in L1. The slide event had a combined New \ac{SNR} of 11.56 and the chirp was visible in the H1 Omega scan. (See Table \ref{tab:big_dog-loudest_slides} for more details.) As with any loud slide-event we checked the \ac{DQ} studies for the week and the e-log to see if we could find an auxillarily channel to veto the times in either of the detectors.\footnote{Since the blind injection is a hardware injection, it is created by actuating one of the mirrors. There is a channel that monitors the input to this mirror, and so it is possible to check whether or not an event is a blind injection without having to wait for the ``envelope" to be opened. We forbid ourselves from checking this channel, however, as it would make the entire challenge pointless.} No cause could be found in either detector, and so the slide event stayed in the data.

When the box was opened the injection was found as \emph{two} events: one in the low chirp-mass bin, and one in the medium chirp-mass bin. Both triggers were found as H1L1 coincidences in H1L1V1 time and had combined \acp{FAR} of zero; i.e., both events were louder than all the background in their respective bins. Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-ifar} shows the open-box H1L1V1-time IFAR plot from the analysis and Table \ref{tab:big_dog-loudest_events} shows the parameters of the two events that were found. That the event created two triggers was a result of our earlier decision to cluster coincident triggers within each chirp-mass bin. Since both triggers had zero combined \acp{FAR} it was not immediately clear which trigger to keep. Further complicating the matter was that the triggers landed exactly on the bin boundary: the low-mass trigger had a chirp mass of $3.47\,\Msun$ and the high mass trigger had a chirp mass of $3.48\,\Msun$; the boundary was $\mchirp = 3.48\,\Msun$. Since we needed to estimate a combined \ac{FAR} for the event, we decided to find an estimate in each bin. Whichever trigger had the lower combined \ac{FAR} we would keep.

In order to estimate a \ac{FAR} for the event we initially combined data from adjacent analysis periods. This was standard procedure; it was done on several different occasions in prior instances when a trigger was found with zero \ac{FAR} in a single week of analysis. However, the event was the loudest H1L1 event in all of S6. Thus, even if we used all the data in S6, we could still only estimate the \emph{uncombined} \ac{FAR} to be $< 1$ in $23$ years. This was not small enough to claim a detection. It was also not clear that using data from all of S6 was the correct approach, since the data quality had changed substantially from S6A to when the event occurred, in S6D. Additionally, computing a combined \ac{FAR} using data from across epochs would have been difficult, since in S6A and B the trials factor in H1L1V1 time was 12, in S6D it was 6, and in S6C there was only H1L1 time. 

To get a better estimate of the \ac{FAR}, two methods were pursued. One was to perform an extrapolation using data from the 100 slides. Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-non_cum_hist-extrap} shows a histogram of all of the H1L1 triggers in S6C and D as a function of combined new \ac{SNR} ($\rhonewc$) in the low and medium chirp-mass bins. Zero-lag triggers are represented as blue dots; slide triggers are black. The blind injection is the blue dot all the way to the right, at $\rhonewc \approx 12$. The structure of the distribution is largely due to $\chi^2$ re-weighting and the \ac{SNR} cutoff: non-Gaussian triggers have been down-weighted, removing any tail in the distribution, and the peak at $\rho_{nc} \approx 8$ is due to the \ac{SNR} cut. Indeed, any trigger below a combined new \ac{SNR} of 7.7 ($= \sqrt{2}\times 5.5$) must be a trigger that was down-weighted, since we apply the \ac{SNR} cut at 5.5. For combined new \acp{SNR} $> 8.5$ the distribution appeared to be Gaussian, particularily in the low chirp-mass bin. We therefore fit a Gaussian to the distribution using the slide data in the range $\rhonewc \in [8.5, \max(\rhonewc)]$. The green-dashed line shows the result of the fit.

Next, we created a cumulative histogram plot in each bin, shown in Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist-extrap}, with the y-axis normalized by the zero-lag duration. Using the fitted parameters from the non-cumulative histograms, we plotted the complimentary error function, which is shown as the green-dashed line, from $\rhonewc = 8.5$ to the combined new \ac{SNR} of the blind injection. Thus, the point on the y-axis where the green-dashed line ends gives the uncombined \ac{FAR} of the blind injection. In the low chirp-mass bin this yielded a \ac{FAR} $\approx 1$ in $4\times 10^{6}$ years, and in the medium bin we obtained a \ac{FAR} $\approx 1$ in $2\times 10^{6}$ years.

On the cumulative histogram plots we additionally plotted the probability density function that the zero-lag events came from the background distribution as a color map. This map was computed using the Poisson distribution (equation \ref{eqn:poisson} in Chapter \ref{ch:far}). At each point along the x-axis, $\lambda$ was determined using the cumulative rate of the closest slide data point greater-than that point. For points past the loudest-slide point (indicated by the vertical black line), the extrapolation is used. Note that this was done prior to dividing by the foreground time, so that the cumulative-rates were unitless; i.e.:
\begin{equation*}
\lambda = N_{\mathrm{cum,slide}} \frac{T_{\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\mathrm{b}}}
\end{equation*}
where $N_{\mathrm{cum,slide}}$ is the number of slide triggers with $\rhonewc \geq$ the combined new \ac{SNR} at the given point on the x-axis, $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the zero-lag live time, and $T_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the total slide live time. The probablity density at each point along the y-axis at that x-value is then determined by plugging in the (unitless) y-value as $k$ in equation \ref{eqn:?}. The entire plot was then divided by $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ to get it into units of $yr^{-1}$. The color map ends at $y = 1 / T_{\mathrm{f}}$ because the Poisson distribution is not defined for $k < 1$. (Technically, it is not defined for any non-integer $k$. To make the plot cleaner we interpolated between integer points using the Gamma Function.) The black dashed-lines indicate $N\sigma$ points, as determined by the Gaussian distribution. For example, $2\sigma$ corresponds to a probabliity density of $0.045$, and so the second black dashed-line maps out points where the distribution is equal to $0.045$. We do this because a false alarm probability equal to $5\sigma$ is generally considered the ``gold" standard for a new detection in the particle physics community.

While the extrapolation appears to fit the low chirp-mass bin well, it clearly deviates from the slide distribution in medium chirp-mass bin. This is largely due to the loudest slide event, which happens to be the event shown in the first row of table \ref{tab:big_dog-loudest_slides}: it resulted from the blind injection in H1 being coincident with a random noise event in L1. If we remove $\pm8\,s$ around the end time of the injection from each detector when performing the slides, then any slide event that could be caused by the blind injection goes away. Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist_no_littles-extrap} shows the cumulative histogram for the low and medium chirp-mass bins when this is done. The low chirp-mass bin is largely unaffected, but in the medium mass bin the fit matches better. The extrapolated \acp{FAR} were largely unaffected when doing this; both low and medium chirp-mass bins still gave $\approx 1$ in $4\times 10^{6}\yr$ and $\approx 1$ in $2\times 10^{6}\yr$, respectively.

We did not feel confident using these extrapolated \acp{FAR}. The validity of extrapolating over six orders of magnitude was hard to determine. Additionally, we had no expected model for the background. Even if new \ac{SNR} removed all non-Gaussian transients above an \ac{SNR} of 5.5 we had no model for the effects of coincidence testing and the various stages of clustering. We chose to fit a Gaussian largely because it worked. However, even when the blind injection was excluded from the background estimation, the extrapolation still appeared to deviate slightly from the slide triggers in the medium chirp-mass bin. This suggested that a Gaussian was not the correct distribution to use in the medium bin.

The 100 slides that we typically do is a small percentage of the total number of possible slides. Thus, another way to estimate the \ac{FAR} was to do more time slides. Since we use offsets that are multiples of $5\,$s between H1 and L1 in the standard search, we decided to do the maximum number of $5\,$s slides that was possible in S6D. We limited the estimation to S6D to try to ensure that the background rate was roughly constant across the period (recall from Chapter \ref{ch:far} that assumming a stationary source is central to the \ac{FAR} analysis). Also, rather than perform slides on rings, we used linear slides. This way we could use single-\ac{IFO} times in the background estimation. Do so, we were able to perform $~4\times 10^6$ slides, resulting in $\sim 1 \times 10^6$ \emph{effective slides}. (Recall from chapter \ref{ch:far} that the effective slide number is obtained by dividing the total slide time by the zero-lag time.) This resulted in a total background live-time of $2.0\times 10^5$ years. To remove any effect on the background estimation from the first coincidence testing, we created a list of single-\ac{IFO} triggers with $\chi^2$ values using a proto-type single-stage pipeline. This pipeline was the same as the \ac{HIPE} pipeline described in Chapter \ref{ch:ihope_pipeline}, except that $\chi^2$ was calculated at first Inspiral and no second stage was carried out. 

Two independent scripts were used to carry out the slides to check the results. Due to the computational cost of doing so many slides, only single-\ac{IFO} triggers that had new \acp{SNR} large enough to cause a coincidence as loud or louder than the injection's combined new \ac{SNR} were considered by both scripts. Additionally, since the injection was found as an H1L1 event, we did not use V1 in the analysis. Thus we effectively combined H1L1V1 time and H1L1 time into one, and pulled out all H1L1 coincidences from potential H1L1V1 triggers. Both scripts agreed with each other. The result was that there were $4$ coincidences with combined new \acp{SNR} $\geq$ the injection's $\rhonewc$ in the low chirp-mass bin, giving an uncombined \ac{FAR} of $1$ in $50,000$ years. In the medium chirp-mass bin there were $5$ louder coincidences, giving an uncombined \ac{FAR} of $1$ in $40,000$ years. This was with the injection left in the background. If the injection was removed, no coincidences were louder than the injection, putting a limit on the uncombined \ac{FAR} of $< 1$ in $200,000$ years. One of the two scripts was able to additionally compute the \ac{FAR} using $1$ second slides. When this was done, one event was found to be louder than the injection even when it were removed in the low chirp-mass bin. In the middle chirp-mass bin, however, there were still no events louder than the injection. Based on this result, along with the fact that the combined new \ac{SNR} was larger in the middle chirp-mass bin, we decided to keep the trigger in the middle bin, i.e., the one with a chirp mass of $3.48\Msun$, and discard the other.

Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-rate_plot} summarizes these results, which is a cumulative histogram in the middle chirp-mass bin. This plot was created in the same manner as the cumulative plots shown in Figures \ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist-extrap} and (minus the extrapolation). Here, the zero-lag triggers in S6D (S6C is not included) are the blue triangles. The background from the standard 100-slide analysis are represented by the dots. The crosses represent the loudest triggers from the $4$ million $5$ second slides. The black dots and crosses are from the background estimations in which the injection was left in the background. The gray dots and crosses are from the background estimation if the injection is excluded. Rather than use a color map to show the probability density, we plotted shaded contours to represent the $1$--$5\,\sigma$ regions. The contours were calculated using the background with the injection left in. Had the injection been a real event, this plot would have been our main figure of merit in the resulting detection paper.

The question of whether or not to leave the injection in the background was hotly debated prior to opening the envelope. If the event were a real gravitaional-wave, we would remove it from the data. Otherwise, leaving it in would break the assumption, made at the end of Chapter \ref{ch:far}, that the total rate density calculated from time-slides is the same as the \ac{FAR}. In this case the noise/GW terms in equation \ref{eqn:eqn:slideTerms} at low \ac{FAR} would be on par with the noise/noise term. Thus we could not make the approximation in equation \ref{eqn:eqn:valid_slide_condition}. Yet if the event were from noise, removing it would underestimate its \ac{FAR}, as well as the \ac{FAR} of all other events. Ultimately we decided to present both backgrounds on the plot (and in the detection paper), but, to be conservative, quote the false alarm rate with the event left in the background. (This is why the background points with the injection left in are black, whereas the event-free background points are light gray, and why the probability contours are based on the former estimate.) Thus the quoted uncombined false alarm rate for the event was $1$ in $40,000$ years.

To get a combined \ac{FAR} for the injection we multiplied the uncombined \ac{FAR} by a trials factor of 6. This gave a final false alarm rate for the event of $\sim1$ in $7000$ years. Since we folded all H1L1 triggers in together, this was a slight overestimate. Had we included V1, some of those triggers would have been H1L1V1 coincidences, and so would have been excluded from the bin. Determining what triggers would have formed triple-coincidences would have been impossible because we folded H1L1 time together with H1L1V1 time. While we could have determined what triggers would have been coincident with V1 in H1L1V1 time, we could not know this in H1L1 time. Since the number of H1L1V1 coincidences are typically small compared to the number of H1L1 triggers, however, this overestmiate would have been minor.

Even with the injection left in the background, the event was still close
to a $5\sigma$ event, as can be seen in \ref{fig:big_dog-rate_plot}. Thus we
went a head with writing a detection paper, and a number of intensive
data-quality investigations were carried out on the period of time. The event
passed all tests.  The LIGO observatories were in quiet night-time operation
with near maximum astrophysical range; the Virgo detector had quiet
environmental conditions, except for elevated micro-seismic levels. The lack of
an observed signal in Virgo was consistent with a \ac{GW}. V1's sensitivity was
a factor of four lower than the LIGO detectors at the time. Since the largest
single-\ac{IFO} \ac{SNR}, recorded in H1, for the event was $\sim15$ (note the
H1 \ac{SNR} in the loudest slides in table \ref{tab:big_dog-loudest_slides}),
it very likely had a \ac{SNR} below our threshold of $5.5$ in V1.

\subsection{Conclusions}

The blind injection challenge in S6 was considered a success. The event was identified, a false alarm rate was calculated, and it was vetted by \ac{DQ} investigations. For the first time we wrote a paper detailing a highly-probable \ac{GW} detection. Had the event been real this paper would have been published. Even though it was not real, the experience gained will prove valuable for the first real detection, which is expected to happen in  advanced LIGO. In addition to highlighting the strengths of our pipeline, it also unearthed some weaknesses. That a \ac{GW} event can hurt its own \ac{FAR} if left in the background estimation was not fully appreciated prior to the exercise. How exactly to deal with this scenario, particularily if there are multiple \acp{GW} in the data, is still an open question. It will be an area of active research between now and advanced LIGO.

After the event was revealed to be a blind injection, a veto was created for it and it was removed from the data. As stated above, with the injection removed, there were no gravitational-wave candidates in S6/VSR2/3. A paper presenting updated upper-limits as well as more details about the blind injection is in progress.

\caption{Cumulative histograms with the blind injection excluded from the time-slides. These plots are generated in the same manner as in Figure \ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist-extrap}. Here, the yellow star represents the blind injection. A Gaussian was fitted to non-cumulative slide distributions with the blind injection removed. The fit values were then used to create the extrapolations, shown as the green-dashed line.}

\caption{The cumulative rate of H1L1 events with chirp mass $3.48 \le \mathcal{M}/\Msun
< 7.40$ in S6D as a function of combined new \ac{SNR} (here, labeled
``Threshold $\rho_c$"). This plot was generated in a manner similar to the
Figures \ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist-extrap} and
\ref{fig:big_dog-cum_hist_no_littles-extrap}, except that no extrapolation was
done. We have also replaced the probability density color map by the gray
shaded contours, which show the $1 - 5\sigma$ (dark to light) regions of the
\ac{PDF}. The blue triangles show coincident events.  Black dots show the
background estimated from 100 time shifts and black crosses show the extended
background estimation from all possible 5-second shifts on this data.  The gray
dots and crosses show the corresponding background estimates when a $\pm 8$
seconds of data around the time of the blind injection are excluded. Had the
blind injection been real, this plot would have been one of the main figures of
merit used in the detection paper.}
