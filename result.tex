\section{Introduction}

Motivation for search: dark matter problem in the galaxy, microlensing
results, Nakamura proposal that MACHOs may be (B)BHs. Predicted rate is
$5\times10^{-2}\times2^{\pm 1}$ events/yr/galaxy is higher than BNS rate.
Waveforms well modelled, same pipeline as S2 BNS. Brief description of sciruns
with reference to instument paper and S2 BNS paper.

\section{Population}

Review Ioka et al paper on BBH formation in the early universe. Density of
local dark matter. Review population models used and make some plots of MACHO
distribution.

\section{Analysis Pipeline and Tuning}

Refer to findchirp paper for trigger generation, gwdaw proceedings and S2
paper for description of pipeline. Give brief description of triggered search
pipeline. Coincidence criteria. Details of tuning MACHO pipeline.

\section{Search Results}

Background, triggers, upper limit. Error analysis for MACHOs.

\section{Conclusions}

Detection? Rate? How close to predicted rate? How long until astrophysically
interresting result?
